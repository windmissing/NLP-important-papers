# 摘要

Adaptive policies are better than fixed policies for simultaneous translation, since they can flexibly balance the tradeoff between translation quality and latency based on the current context information. But previous methods on obtaining adaptive policies either rely on complicated training process, or underperform simple fixed policies. We design an algorithm to achieve adaptive policies via a simple heuristic composition of a set of fixed policies. Experiments on Chinese→English and German→English show that our adaptive policies can outperform fixed ones by up to 4 BLEU points for the same latency, and more surprisingly, it even surpasses the BLEU score of full-sentence translation in the greedy mode (and very close to beam mode), but with much lower latency. 

# 要解决什么问题

动态策略可以平衡翻译质量与延时之间的关系。  

# 作者的主要贡献

将固定策略以一种简单启发式的方法组合，得到动态策略算法。  

# 得到了什么结果

Chinese→English and German→English    4 BLEU提升     在同样延时条件下  
全句翻译场景中BLEU更高而延时更小。
