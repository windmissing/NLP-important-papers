# 摘要

The main goal of machine translation has been to convey the correct content. Stylistic considerations have been at best secondary. We show that as a consequence, the output of three commercial machine translation systems (Bing, DeepL, Google) make demographically diverse samples from five languages “sound” older and more male than the original. Our findings suggest that translation models reflect demographic bias in the training data. These results open up interesting new research avenues in machine translation to take stylistic considerations into account.

Stylistic considerations：风格上考虑    
demographically diverse samples：人口统计学样本  
demographic bias：人口偏差  

# 要解决什么问题  

NMT不太重视风格上的考虑，导致翻译结果倾向于older和male。
