# 摘要

Multilingual neural machine translation (NMT) has led to impressive accuracy improvements in low-resource scenarios by sharing common linguistic information across languages. However, the traditional multilingual model fails to capture the diversity and specificity of different languages, resulting in inferior performance compared with individual models that are sufficiently trained. In this paper, we incorporate a language-aware interlingua into the Encoder-Decoder architecture. The interlingual network enables the model to learn a language-independent representation from the semantic spaces of different languages, while still allowing for language-specific specialization of a particular language-pair. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves remarkable improvements over state-of-the-art multilingual NMT baselines and produces comparable performance with strong individual models.

# 要解决什么问题

多语言模型无法捕获不同语言的多样性和特殊性。

# 作者的主要贡献

将interlingua整合到Encoder-Decoder结构中，用于学习与语言无关的表示，同时允许特定语言的特殊性。

# 得到了什么结果

性能优于STOA多语言NMT
