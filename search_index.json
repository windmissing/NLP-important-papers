Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\n  \nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by dk\\sqrt{d_k}dk​​, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute the matrix of outputs as:   \nAttention(Q,K,V)=softmax(QK⊤dk)V\nAttention(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}(\\frac{QK^\\top}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V\nAttention(Q,K,V)=softmax(​√​d​k​​​​​​​QK​⊤​​​​)V\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1dk\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_k}}dk​​1​. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.While for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4 .   \n\n[info]4 To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random variables with mean 0 and variance 1.

On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2.  \nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.

Applications of Attention in our Model\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9].   \n\n[success]这里用的是recurrent attention mechanism。历史的encoder输入都会被记录和用于这里的注意力机制中。query: decoderkey: encodervalue: encoder\n\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.   \n\n[success]这里用的是self-attention。query、key、value都是所有position的上一层encoder的输出。   \n\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections.

Despite of the promising progress achieved by recent studies in this field, persona information tends to be incorporated into neural networks in the form of user embeddings, with the expectation that the persona can be involved via End-to-End learning. This paper proposes to adopt the personalityrelated characteristics of human conversations into variational response generators, by designing a specific conditional variational autoencoder based deep model with two new regularization terms employed to the loss function, so as to guide the optimization towards the direction of generating both persona-aware and relevant responses. Besides, to reasonably evaluate the performances of various persona modeling approaches, this paper further presents three direct persona-oriented metrics from different perspectives. The experimental results have shown that our proposed methodology can notably improve the performance of persona-aware response generation, and the metrics are reasonable to evaluate the results. \n4. 要解决什么问题\n在对话中融入agents的个性。\n5. 作者的主要贡献\n\n在agents的回答中加入个性条件变量自动编码器、深度网络、两种新的正则化技术  \n3种评价个性的机制  \n\n6. 得到了什么结果\n明显地提升回答的个性评价机制合理。\n7. 关键字\n个性化\n"},"ACL_2020/8.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/8.html","title":"2020.acl-main.8","keywords":"","body":"1.

This paper addresses these issues by controlling an agent’s persona upon generation via conditioning on prior conversations of a target actor. In doing so, we are able to utilize more abstract patterns within a person’s speech and better emulate them in generated responses. This work introduces the GENERATIVE CONVERSATION CONTROL model, an augmented and fine-tuned GPT-2 language model that conditions on past reference conversations to probabilistically model multi-turn conversations in the actor’s persona. We introduce an accompanying data collection procedure to obtain 10.3M conversations from 6 months worth of Reddit comments. We demonstrate that scaling model sizes from 117M to 8.3B parameters yields an improvement from 23.14 to 13.14 perplexity on 1.7M held out Reddit conversations. Increasing model scale yielded similar improvements in human evaluations that measure preference of model samples to the held out target distribution in terms of realism (31% increased to 37% preference), style matching (37% to 42%), grammar and content quality (29% to 42%), and conversation coherency (32% to 40%). We find that conditionally modeling past conversations improves perplexity by 0.47 in automatic evaluations.

In this paper, we study slot consistency for building reliable NLG systems with all slot values of input dialogue act (DA) properly generated in output sentences. We propose Iterative Rectification Network (IRN) for improving general NLG systems to produce both correct and fluent responses. It applies a bootstrapping algorithm to sample training candidates and uses reinforcement learning to incorporate discrete reward related to slot inconsistency into training. Comprehensive studies have been conducted on multiple benchmark datasets, showing that the proposed methods have significantly reduced the slot error rate (ERR) for all strong baselines.

We show that leveraging such knowledge in Span-ConveRT is especially useful for few-shot learning scenarios: we report consistent gains over 1) a span extractor that trains representations from scratch in the target domain, and 2) a BERTbased span extractor. In order to inspire more work on span extraction for the slot-filling task, we also release RESTAURANTS-8K, a new challenging data set of 8,198 utterances, compiled from actual conversations in the restaurant booking domain.\n4. 要解决什么问题\ndialog slot-filling[?] 没有搜到这种类型的Task  \n5. 作者的主要贡献\n把dialog slot-filling变成了turn-based span extraction任务。把对话知识集成到预训练的对话模型中。[?] 没看懂\n6. 得到了什么结果\n对于 few shot场景，非常有用。[?] 没看懂  \n7. 关键字\n"},"ACL_2020/15.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/15.html","title":"2020.acl-main.11","keywords":"","body":"1.

Paper title\nA Study of Non-autoregressive Model for Sequence Generation\n2. link\nhttps://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.15.pdf\n3. 摘要\nNon-autoregressive (NAR) models generate all the tokens of a sequence in parallel, resulting in faster generation speed compared to their autoregressive (AR) counterparts but at the cost of lower accuracy. Different techniques including knowledge distillation and source-target alignment have been proposed to bridge the gap between AR and NAR models in various tasks such as neural machine translation (NMT), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and text to speech (TTS). With the help of those techniques, NAR models can catch up with the accuracy of AR models in some tasks but not in some others. In this work, we conduct a study to understand the difficulty of NAR sequence generation and try to answer: (1) Why NAR models can catch up with AR models in some tasks but not all? (2) Why techniques like knowledge distillation and source-target alignment can help NAR models. Since the main difference between AR and NAR models is that NAR models do not use dependency among target tokens while AR models do, intuitively the difficulty of NAR sequence generation heavily depends on the strongness of dependency among target tokens. To quantify such dependency, we propose an analysis model called CoMMA to characterize the difficulty of different NAR sequence generation tasks. We have several interesting findings: 1) Among the NMT, ASR and TTS tasks, ASR has the most target-token dependency while TTS has the least. 2) Knowledge distillation reduces the target-token dependency in target sequence and thus improves the accuracy of NAR models. 3) Source-target alignment constraint encourages dependency of a target token on source tokens and thus eases the training of NAR models.\n4. 要解决什么问题\nNAR相对于AR，生成速度更快而精度降低。在某些任务上，通过一些技术能够缩小NAR和AR之间的精度GAP。  \n5. 作者的主要贡献\n研究关于：（1）为什么NAR在某些任务上能达到AR的水平（2）为什么某些技术能够提升NAR的性能？结论是与token之间的Dependency有关。  \nCoMMA：分析与衡量token之间的Dependency。  \n6. 得到了什么结果\n（1）token dependency：ASR > NMT > TTS（2）Knowledge distillation减少token dependency，提升NAR性能（3）Source-target alignment constraint鼓励token dependency，使NAR容易训练    \n7. 关键字\n关于NAR的理论研究\n"},"ACL_2020/20.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/20.html","title":"2020.acl-main.20","keywords":"","body":"1.

An alternative approach to tackle the problem is to use automatically generated QA pairs from either the problem context or from large amount of unstructured texts (e.g. Wikipedia). In this work, we propose a hierarchical conditional variational autoencoder (HCVAE) for generating QA pairs given unstructured texts as contexts, while maximizing the mutual information between generated QA pairs to ensure their consistency. We validate our Information Maximizing Hierarchical Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (InfoHCVAE) on several benchmark datasets by evaluating the performance of the QA model (BERT-base) using only the generated QA pairs (QA-based evaluation) or by using both the generated and human-labeled pairs (semisupervised learning) for training, against stateof-the-art baseline models. The results show that our model obtains impressive performance gains over all baselines on both tasks, using only a fraction of data for training. 1 \n4. 要解决什么问题\nQA问题缺少labelled data，需要根据文本自动生成问题对。\n5. 作者的主要贡献\n\n用hierarchical conditional variational autoencoder (HCVAE)生成QA对  \n确保生成的QA对的一致性。  \n\n6. 得到了什么结果\n同时使用生成QA对和真实QA对训练得到的性能优于只使用真实QA对训练的性能。\n7. 关键字\n生成QA对\n"},"ACL_2020/23.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/23.html","title":"2020.acl-main.23","keywords":"","body":"1.

Current conditional generation models cannot handle emerging conditions due to their joint end-to-end learning fashion. When a new condition added, these techniques require full retraining. In this paper, we present a new framework named Pre-train and Plug-in Variational Auto-Encoder (PPVAE) towards flexible conditional text generation. PPVAE decouples the text generation module from the condition representation module to allow “one-to-many” conditional generation. When a fresh condition emerges, only a lightweight network needs to be trained and works as a plug-in for PPVAE, which is efficient and desirable for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PPVAE against the existing alternatives with better conditionality and diversity but less training effort.1\n4. 要解决什么问题\n在当前的条件文本生成模型中，当有一个新的条件出现时，需要整个重新训练。  \n5. 作者的主要贡献\nPPVAE：预训练+插件的VAE，用于灵活条件的场景。将文本生成模型和条件表示模块解耦。当出现新的条件时，只需要继续训练调整参数。\n6. 得到了什么结果\n条件和多样性更好训练开销更小。  \n7. 关键字\n动态条件\n"},"ACL_2020/25.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/25.html","title":"2020.acl-main.25","keywords":"","body":"1.

The study of artifacts that emerge in machine generated text as a result of modeling choices is a nascent research area. Previously, the extent and degree to which these artifacts surface in generated text has not been well studied. In the spirit of better understanding generative text models and their artifacts, we propose the new task of distinguishing which of several variants of a given model generated a piece of text, and we conduct an extensive suite of diagnostic tests to observe whether modeling choices (e.g., sampling methods, top-k probabilities, model architectures, etc.) leave detectable artifacts in the text they generate. Our key finding, which is backed by a rigorous set of experiments, is that such artifacts are present and that different modeling choices can be inferred by observing the generated text alone. This suggests that neural text generators may be more sensitive to various modeling choices than previously thought. \nnascent：新生的  \n4. 要解决什么问题\n模型的选择对生成的文本的影响。  \n5. 作者的主要贡献\n一种新的task：根据生成的文本判断它是由哪个模型生成的。分析模型选择是否在生成的文本上留下痕迹。  \n6. 得到了什么结果\n可以通过生成的文本推断使用了哪种模型。生成的文本对模型的依赖比我们认为的大。  \n7. 关键字\n模型对生成文本的影响\n"},"ACL_2020/34.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/34.html","title":"2020.acl-main.34","keywords":"","body":"1.

However, NMT does not consider the importance of word in the sentence meaning, for example, some words (i.e., content words) express more important meaning than others (i.e., function words). To address this limitation, we first utilize word frequency information to distinguish between content and function words in a sentence, and then design a content word-aware NMT to improve translation performance.

However, few works have adopted this technique in the sequence-to-sequence models. In this work, we introduce a jointly masked sequence-to-sequence model and explore its application on non-autoregressive neural machine translation (NAT). Specifically, we first empirically study the functionalities of the encoder and the decoder in NAT models, and find that the encoder takes a more important role than the decoder regarding the translation quality. Therefore, we propose to train the encoder more rigorously by masking the encoder input while training. As for the decoder, we propose to train it based on the consecutive masking of the decoder input with an n-gram loss function to alleviate the problem of translating duplicate words. The two types of masks are applied to the model jointly at the training stage. We conduct experiments on five benchmark machine translation tasks, and our model can achieve 27.69/32.24 BLEU scores on WMT14 English-German/German-English tasks with 5+ times speed up compared with an autoregressive model.

In this paper, we present a MultiScale Collaborative (MSC) framework to ease the training of NMT models that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly boost the gradient backpropagation from top to bottom levels by introducing a block-scale collaboration mechanism into deep NMT models. Then, instead of forcing the whole encoder stack directly learns a desired representation, we let each encoder block learns a fine-grained representation and enhance it by encoding spatial dependencies using a context-scale collaboration. We provide empirical evidence showing that the MSC nets are easy to optimize and can obtain improvements of translation quality from considerably increased depth. On IWSLT translation tasks with three translation directions, our extremely deep models (with 72-layer encoders) surpass strong baselines by +2.2∼+3.1 BLEU points. In addition, our deep MSC achieves a BLEU score of 30.56 on WMT14 English→German task that significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep NMT models.\n4. 要解决什么问题\nNMT模型的结构通常为encoder-decoder + attention   \n深度神经网络难以训练，CV解决此问题的方法有：  \n\nresidual connection  \ndensely connected networks  \ndeep layer aggregation  \n\n深度神经网络在NLP以下方向有用：  \n\n语言模型  \nQA  \n文本分类  \n自然语言推断  \n\nNMT变深后性能会恶化，以下方法可以优化深度NMT的性能：  \n\ntransparent attention mechanism  \npre-norm method但以上技术只能让NMT深度达到20-30层，30层以上性能仍会恶化。  \n\n因此作者提出问题：  \n\nHow to break the limitation of depth in NMT models?  \nHow to fully utilize the deeper structure to further improve the translation quality?  \n\n5. 作者的主要贡献\nMultiScale Collaborative framework --- MSC引入block-scale collabration机制，具体做法如下：   \n\n把整个encoder stack分成多个encoder block  \nencoder和decoder有同样的block数  \n每个encoder block各自学习一个fine-grained表示。  \n用bottom-up网络网络做encoding spatial dependencies[?].  \n使用context-scale collabration对spatial dependency进行编码来增强上述表示。  \n\nMCS的优点：  \n\n传播路径变短  \n防止底层信息丢失  \n\n6. 得到了什么结果\n\n深度变深时，传统模型性能差，而MMSC易于优化  \n72层的MSC的翻译性能有大量提升，性能优于Benchmark。WMT14 English→German     BLEU     30.56    ，优于baseline 2.5,    优于SOTA且参数更少\n\n7. 关键字\nEncoder, deep\n"},"ACL_2020/41.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/41.html","title":"2020.acl-main.41","keywords":"","body":"1.

As the NMT architectures become deeper and wider, this issue gets worse and worse. In this paper, we aim to improve the efficiency of training an NMT by introducing a novel norm-based curriculum learning method. We use the norm (aka length or module) of a word embedding as a measure of 1) the difficulty of the sentence, 2) the competence of the model, and 3) the weight of the sentence. The normbased sentence difficulty takes the advantages of both linguistically motivated and modelbased sentence difficulties. It is easy to determine and contains learning-dependent features. The norm-based model competence makes NMT learn the curriculum in a fully automated way, while the norm-based sentence weight further enhances the learning of the vector representation of the NMT. Experimental results for the WMT’14 English– German and WMT’17 Chinese–English translation tasks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines in terms of BLEU score (+1.17/+1.56) and training speedup (2.22x/3.33x). \n4. 要解决什么问题\nNMT的特点是：1. 需要大量的训练数据 2. 跨语言的工作设定，因此需要更多的训练时间。当网络变深变宽时，训练NMT非常expensive。Transformer是最常用的NMT架构，改进的transformer有：  \n\n30层以上的深度模型  \n巨大batch size的scaling NMT  \nCurriculum Learning让NMT训练得更快。  \n\nCurriculum Learning是指训练时让样本从简单到难，因此对样本难度的评价很关键。已有评价方法：  \n\n语言驱动，容易计算  \n基于模型，有用但难计算   \n\n5. 作者的主要贡献\n引入norm-based curriculum learning method来提升训练的效果。  \n\n提供难度评价算法：norm-based原理：高频词和内容不敏感的罕见词的范数值较小。因此norm-based能同时表达语言驱动和基于模型这两种方法的特征。  \n\nnorm计算出来之后用于衡量以下内容：(1) 句子的难度 （2）模型的能力 （3）句子的权重1/2/3是基于word embedding计算的，3又反过来影响embedding    \n\n\n本文方法的特点：  \n\n自动安排课程， practical NMT system  \n把句子的难度结合到课程安排中  \n\n6. 得到了什么结果\n\n性能更好WMT 14 English– German     BLEU     +1.17    speedup     2.22xWMT17 Chinese–English     BLEU     + 1.56     speedup     3.33x\n训练更快  \n不需要引入额外的参数  \n\n7. 关键字\nEncoder，curriculum , efficiency, deep\n"},"ACL_2020/42.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/42.html","title":"2020.acl-main.42","keywords":"","body":"1.

Most existing frameworks, however, have difficulties in balancing between the translation quality and latency, i.e., the decoding policy is usually either too aggressive or too conservative. We propose an opportunistic decoding technique with timely correction ability, which always (over-)generates a certain mount of extra words at each step to keep the audience on track with the latest information. At the same time, it also corrects, in a timely fashion, the mistakes in the former overgenerated words when observing more source context to ensure high translation quality. Experiments show our technique achieves substantial reduction in latency and up to +3.1 increase in BLEU, with revision rate under 8% in Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese translation.     \nConservative:保守\nin a timely fashion：及时地substantial reduction:大幅减少  \n3. 要解决什么问题\nST存在为了降低延时而在信息不足的情况下翻译\n\n难以选择合适的policy，解码工作常常太激进（关注latency）或太保守(关注quality)。    \n不能改进前面步骤的错误。  \n\n4. 作者的主要贡献\n具有实时校正能力的机会解码技术。(1)预生成一定的推测单词，opportunistic decoding技术(2)及时纠正之前预生成的单词中的错误，timely correction机制。  \n本文方法过程：  \n\ndecode more words than policy  \nreview the extra outputs  \nrevise these output  \n\n使用场景：  \n\nspeech to text  \nspeech to speech，extra words放在look-ahead window中。  \n\n提升一种评价revision-enables NMT的指标：  \n\nRAL，评价延时  \n修正率  \n\n5. 得到了什么结果\nlatency大幅减少Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese     BLEU     +3.1     revision rate     8%  \n6. 关键字\nSimultaneous translation(同时翻译)    \n"},"ACL_2020/54.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/54.html","title":"2020.acl-main.54","keywords":"","body":"1.

The traditional approach to building such a dialogue system is to take a pipelined modular architecture, where its modules are optimized individually. However, such an optimization scheme does not necessarily yield an overall performance improvement of the whole system. On the other hand, end-to-end dialogue systems with monolithic neural architecture are often trained only with input-output utterances, without taking into account the entire annotations available in the corpus. This scheme makes it difficult for goal-oriented dialogues where the system needs to be integrated with external systems or to provide interpretable information about why the system generated a particular response. In this paper, we present an end-to-end neural architecture for dialogue systems that addresses both challenges above. Our dialogue system achieved the success rate of 68.32%, the language understanding score of 4.149, and the response appropriateness score of 4.287 in human evaluations, which ranked the system at the top position in the end-to-end multi-domain dialogue system task in the 8th dialogue systems technology challenge (DSTC8). \nmonolithic neural architecture：整体神经架构utterances：话语annotations：注解  \n4. 要解决什么问题\n任务型对话系统有两种架构。pipeline架构对各个部分分别优化而不能保证整体性能最优。end-to-end架构直接使用输入输出来训练整体神经架构，难以与其它系统集成，或者提供可解释信息。  \n5. 作者的主要贡献\n提供一种能同时解决以上两个问题的end-to-end架构。  \n6. 得到了什么结果\nDSTC8比赛上第一名。成功率：68.32%， language understanding score：4.149， response appropriateness score：4.287  \n7. 关键字\n任务型对话系统\n"},"ACL_2020/57.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/57.html","title":"2020.acl-main.57","keywords":"","body":"1.

We also design a method to automatically construct paraphrase training data set based on dialog state and dialog act labels. PARG is applicable to various dialog generation models, such as TSCP (Lei et al., 2018) and DAMD (Zhang et al., 2019).

A scenario where informativeness can be significantly enhanced is Conversing by Reading (CbR), where conversations take place with respect to a given external document. In previous work, the external document is utilized by (1) creating a contextaware document memory that integrates information from the document and the conversational context, and then (2) generating responses referring to the memory. In this paper, we propose to create the document memory with some anticipated responses in mind. This is achieved using a teacher-student framework.

Standard language generation metrics have been shown to be ineffective for evaluating dialog models. To this end, this paper presents USR, an UnSupervised and Reference-free evaluation metric for dialog. USR is a reference-free metric that trains unsupervised models to measure several desirable qualities of dialog. USR is shown to strongly correlate with human judgment on both Topical-Chat (turn-level: 0.42, systemlevel: 1.0) and PersonaChat (turn-level: 0.48 and system-level: 1.0). USR additionally produces interpretable measures for several desirable properties of dialog.\n4. 要解决什么问题\n开放领域对话缺有效的自动估计指标。\n5. 作者的主要贡献\nUSR: 一种无监督、无参与的对话评估指标\n6. 得到了什么结果\nUSR的评估结果与人工评估结果有很强的相关性。TopicalChat     turn-level     0.42     systemlevel     1.0PersonaChat     turn-level     0.48     systemlevel     1.0USR提供了可解释性度量。  \n7. 关键字\nEvaluation, open-domain\n"},"ACL_2020/67.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/67.html","title":"2020.acl-main.67","keywords":"","body":"1.

This work focuses on AMR-to-text generation – A graph-to-sequence task aiming to recover natural language from Abstract Meaning Representations (AMR). Existing graph-to-sequence approaches generally utilize graph neural networks as their encoders, which have two limitations: 1) The message propagation process in AMR graphs is only guided by the firstorder adjacency information. 2) The relationships between labeled edges are not fully considered. In this work, we propose a novel graph encoding framework which can effectively explore the edge relations. We also adopt graph attention networks with higherorder neighborhood information to encode the rich structure in AMR graphs. Experiment results show that our approach obtains new state-of-the-art performance on English AMR benchmark datasets. The ablation analyses also demonstrate that both edge relations and higher-order information are beneficial to graph-to-sequence modeling. \n4. 要解决什么问题\ngraph-to-sequence常用的模型具有以下局限性：（1）AMR图中的消息传播过程仅由一阶邻接信息指导。[?]没看懂（2）没有充分考虑标记边缘之间的关系。  \n5. 作者的主要贡献\n新的graph encoding框架：（1）探索边缘关系（2）采用具有高阶邻域信息的图注意力网络对AMR图中的丰富结构进行编码  \n6. 得到了什么结果\nEnglish AMR benchmark datasets中性能优于SOTA。边缘关系和高阶信息都整合到模型中。  \n7. 关键字\ngraph-to-sequence\n"},"ACL_2020/68.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/68.html","title":"2020.acl-main.68","keywords":"","body":"1.

One common characteristic of most of the tasks is that the texts are not restricted to some rigid formats when generating. However, we may confront some special text paradigms such as Lyrics (assume the music score is given), Sonnet, SongCi (classical Chinese poetry of the Song dynasty), etc. The typical characteristics of these texts are in three folds: (1) They must comply fully with the rigid predefined formats. (2) They must obey some rhyming schemes. (3) Although they are restricted to some formats, the sentence integrity must be guaranteed. To the best of our knowledge, text generation based on the predefined rigid formats has not been well investigated. Therefore, we propose a simple and elegant framework named SongNet to tackle this problem. The backbone of the framework is a Transformer-based auto-regressive language model. Sets of symbols are tailor-designed to improve the modeling performance especially on format, rhyme, and sentence integrity. We improve the attention mechanism to impel the model to capture some future information on the format. A pre-training and fine-tuning framework is designed to further improve the generation quality. Extensive experiments conducted on two collected corpora demonstrate that our proposed framework generates significantly better results in terms of both automatic metrics and the human evaluation.1 \nbackbone：骨干\n4. 要解决什么问题\n对文本形式有特殊要求的文本生成。\n5. 作者的主要贡献\nSongNet：基于transformer的自回归语言模型[?]transformer[?]自回归Sets of symbols are tailor-designed包含注意力机制、预训练、fine-tune。  \n6. 得到了什么结果\n使用自动评价和人工评价都得到了好的结果。  \n7. 关键字\n特定格式的文本生成\n"},"ACL_2020/76.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/76.html","title":"2020.acl-main.76","keywords":"","body":"1.

To resolve this limitation, we propose a novel deep bidirectional language model called a Transformer-based Text Autoencoder (T-TA). The T-TA computes contextual language representations without repetition and displays the benefits of a deep bidirectional architecture, such as that of BERT. In computation time experiments in a CPU environment, the proposed T-TA performs over six times faster than the BERT-like model on a reranking task and twelve times faster on a semantic similarity task. Furthermore, the T-TA shows competitive or even better accuracies than those of BERT on the above tasks.

A bilingual language model is expected to model the sequential dependency for words across languages, which is difficult due to the inherent lack of suitable training data as well as diverse syntactic structure across languages. We propose a bilingual attention language model (BALM) that simultaneously performs language modeling objective with a quasi-translation objective to model both the monolingual as well as the cross-lingual sequential dependency. The attention mechanism learns the bilingual context from a parallel corpus. BALM achieves state-of-theart performance on the SEAME code-switch database by reducing the perplexity of 20.5% over the best-reported result. We also apply BALM in bilingual lexicon induction, and language normalization tasks to validate the idea.\n4. 要解决什么问题\n5. 作者的主要贡献\n6. 得到了什么结果\n7. 关键字\n"},"ACL_2020/94.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/94.html","title":"2020.acl-main.94","keywords":"","body":"1.

The structures of embedding spaces largely depend on the cooccurrence statistics of each word, which the choice of context window determines. Despite this obvious connection between the context window and mapping-based cross-lingual embeddings, their relationship has been underexplored in prior work. In this work, we provide a thorough evaluation, in various languages, domains, and tasks, of bilingual embeddings trained with different context windows. The highlight of our findings is that increasing the size of both the source and target window sizes improves the performance of bilingual lexicon induction, especially the performance on frequent nouns.\n4. 要解决什么问题\ncontext window决定了共现统计，共现统计了embedding空间的结构。context window和embedding的其它关系？  \n5. 作者的主要贡献\n对多个任务、领域、语言的双语embedding做评估\n6. 得到了什么结果\n增加context window的大小能够提升性能。  \n7. 关键字\nmapping-based\n"},"ACL_2020/98.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/98.html","title":"2020.acl-main.98","keywords":"","body":"1.

To facilitate the study of this task, we create a human-to-human Chinese dialog dataset DuRecDial (about 10k dialogs, 156k utterances), which contains multiple sequential dialogs for every pair of a recommendation seeker (user) and a recommender (bot). In each dialog, the recommender proactively leads a multi-type dialog to approach recommendation targets and then makes multiple recommendations with rich interaction behavior. This dataset allows us to systematically investigate different parts of the overall problem, e.g., how to naturally lead a dialog, how to interact with users for recommendation.

Most existing methods ignore the faithfulness between a generated text description and the original table, leading to generated information that goes beyond the content of the table. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a novel Transformerbased generation framework to achieve the goal. The core techniques in our method to enforce faithfulness include a new table-text optimal-transport matching loss and a tabletext embedding similarity loss based on the Transformer model. Furthermore, to evaluate faithfulness, we propose a new automatic metric specialized to the table-to-text generation problem. We also provide detailed analysis on each component of our model in our experiments.

Given a context, current systems are able to yield a relevant and fluent response, but sometimes make logical mistakes because of weak reasoning capabilities. To facilitate the conversation reasoning research, we introduce MuTual, a novel dataset for Multi-Turn dialogue Reasoning, consisting of 8,860 manually annotated dialogues based on Chinese student English listening comprehension exams. Compared to previous benchmarks for non-task oriented dialogue systems, MuTual is much more challenging since it requires a model that can handle various reasoning problems. Empirical results show that state-of-the-art methods only reach 71%, which is far behind the human performance of 94%, indicating that there is ample room for improving reasoning ability.

Motivated by this, we propose P 2 BOT, a transmitter-receiver based framework with the aim of explicitly modeling understanding. Specifically, P 2 BOT incorporates mutual persona perception to enhance the quality of personalized dialogue generation.

We propose anchored training (AT) to tackle the task. AT uses the bilingual dictionary to establish anchoring points for closing the gap between source language and target language. Experiments on various language pairs show that our approaches are significantly better than various baselines, including dictionary-based word-byword translation, dictionary-supervised crosslingual word embedding transformation, and unsupervised MT.

We show that translations based on fuzzy matching provide the model with “copy” information while translations based on embedding similarities tend to extend the translation “context”. Results indicate that the effect from both similar sentences are adding up to further boost accuracy, are combining naturally with model fine-tuning and are providing dynamic adaptation for unseen translation pairs.

In this paper, we explore ways to improve them. We argue that multilingual NMT requires stronger modeling capacity to support language pairs with varying typological characteristics, and overcome this bottleneck via language-specific components and deepening NMT architectures. We identify the off-target translation issue (i.e. translating into a wrong target language) as the major source of the inferior zero-shot performance, and propose random online backtranslation to enforce the translation of unseen training language pairs. Experiments on OPUS-100 (a novel multilingual dataset with 100 languages) show that our approach substantially narrows the performance gap with bilingual models in both oneto-many and many-to-many settings, and improves zero-shot performance by ∼10 BLEU, approaching conventional pivot-based methods.    \nbacktranslation：反向翻译  \n4. motivation\n多语言翻译是指用一个NMT模型来做多个语言之间的翻译。  \n多语言NMT的优点：  \n\n便于模型部署  \n促进相关语言之间的知识迁移  \n提升low-resource翻译  \n使zero-shot翻译成为可能  \n\n多语言NMT存在的问题：问题1：多语言NMT性能差于双语NMT。问题2：多语言NMT处理zero-shot数据时（相对于pivot-based模型）会出现“off-target translation问题”，即翻译成一个错误的语言。[?] pivot-based methods  \n5. 已有的解决问题的方法\n5.1. 针对问题1：\n\n每个语言都有对应的encoder/decoder  \n\n例如：一对多翻译，共享encoder多对多翻译，多个语言共享attention mechanism  \n缺点：scalability受到限制。  \n\n把不同语言映射到同一个表示空间  \n\n例如：with a target language symbol guiding the translation direction\n缺点：忽略了不同语言的linguistic diversity  \n\n在2的基础上，加入“语言的linguistic diversity”的考虑\n\n例如：reorganizing parameter sharingdesigning language-specific parameter generatordecoupling multilingual word encoding  \n本文是以2为baseline探索3的方法  \n5.2. 针对问题2：\n多语言NMT处理zero-shot数据时（相对于pivot-based模型）会出现“off-target translation问题”，即翻译成一个错误的语言。  \n出现问题的原因：  \n\nmissing ingredient problem  \nspurious correlation issue  \n\n解决方法：  \n\n跨语言正则化  \ngenerating artificial parallel data with backtranslation  \n\n本文探索3的方法来解决zero-shot问题\n6. 作者的主要贡献\n针对问题1：作者认为造成问题1的原因是模型容量的不足。（1）language-aware层归一化（2）线性变换[?] 1和2的目的是relax the representation constraint，为什么1和2能得到这样的效果呢？[?] 2位于encoder和decoder之间，目的是facilitate the induction of language-specific translation correspondences。这句话是什么意思呢？（3）深层的NMT架构  \n针对问题2：（1）作者提供random online backtranslation （ROBT）算法finetunes a pretrained multilingual NMT model for unseen training language pairs with pseudo parallel batches generated by back-trainlating the target-side training data.[?] 不太懂  \n提供OPUS-100数据集：（1）55M条句子对（2）包含100种语言  \n以Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017)为benchmark  \n7. 得到了什么结果\n\n增加模型容量可以提升性能，减少多语言NMT与双语NMT之间的gap  \nlanguage-specific模型和尝试NMT能提升zero-shot的性能，但对解决off-target tranlation问题没有帮助  \nROBT算法减少off-target出现的概率，在zero-shot问题上性能比pivot-based methods提升10 BLEU。\n\n8. 关键字\nzero-shot、多语言翻译\n"},"ACL_2020/150.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/150.html","title":"2020.acl-main.150","keywords":"","body":"1.

However, the traditional multilingual model fails to capture the diversity and specificity of different languages, resulting in inferior performance compared with individual models that are sufficiently trained. In this paper, we incorporate a language-aware interlingua into the Encoder-Decoder architecture. The interlingual network enables the model to learn a language-independent representation from the semantic spaces of different languages, while still allowing for language-specific specialization of a particular language-pair. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves remarkable improvements over state-of-the-art multilingual NMT baselines and produces comparable performance with strong individual models.\n4. 要解决什么问题\n多语言NMT是指在一个模型中handle多种语言对。  \n多语言NMT的优点：  \n\n减少online serving的成本  \n减少offline training的成本  \n提升low-resource语言对的翻译性能。  \n\n多语言NMT的challenge：语言多样性和模型能力限制的矛盾    \n多语言模型的改进：  \n\n提升模型容量  \n引入multiple encoder & decoder  \n改进注意力机制，关注language specific signals  \nmodel the specifity of different languages  \n[?] 增加pre-designed tokens  \n\n多语言模型无法捕获不同语言的多样性和特殊性。\n5. 作者的主要贡献\n引入language-aware的中介语模块，将interlingua（中介语）整合到Encoder-Decoder结构中，用于学习与语言无关的表示，同时允许特定语言的特殊性。中介语模块的作用：  \n\nmodel the shared specific space  \n作为encoder和decoder之间的桥梁  \n\n本文的过程和方法：  \n\nlanguage embedding，用于表达每个语言的特征  \ninterlingua embedding，捕获所有语言的通用语义   \n注意力机制：把encoder映射到共享语义空间  \nreconstruction loss和语义一致性损失函数：保证语义一致  \nlanguage-aware positional embedding：作为初始状态  \n\n6. 得到了什么结果\n性能优于STOA多语言NMT\n7. 关键字\n"},"ACL_2020/152.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/152.html","title":"2020.acl-main.152","keywords":"","body":"1.

This affects the design of translation interfaces, as the task changes from mainly generating text to correcting errors within otherwise helpful translation proposals. Since this paradigm shift offers potential for modalities other than mouse and keyboard, we present MMPE, the first prototype to combine traditional input modes with pen, touch, and speech modalities for PE of MT. The results of an evaluation with professional translators suggest that pen and touch interaction are suitable for deletion and reordering tasks, while they are of limited use for longer insertions. On the other hand, speech and multi-modal combinations of select & speech are considered suitable for replacements and insertions but offer less potential for deletion and reordering. Overall, participants were enthusiastic about the new modalities and saw them as good extensions to mouse & keyboard, but not as a complete substitute.\npost-editing：后期编辑  \n4. 要解决什么问题\n翻译人员需要对MT的翻译结果做后期处理。  \n5. 作者的主要贡献\nMMPE：一种方便对翻译结果做后期处理的笔。  \n6. 得到了什么结果\nMMPE是对鼠标、键盘的良好扩展。  \n7. 关键字\n硬件\n"},"ACL_2020/164.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/164.html","title":"2020.acl-main.164","keywords":"","body":"1.

The capabilities of humans and automatic discriminators to detect machine-generated text have been a large source of research interest, but humans and machines rely on different cues to make their decisions. Here, we perform careful benchmarking and analysis of three popular sampling-based decoding strategies—topk, nucleus sampling, and untruncated random sampling—and show that improvements in decoding methods have primarily optimized for fooling humans. This comes at the expense of introducing statistical abnormalities that make detection easy for automatic systems. We also show that though both human and automatic detector performance improve with longer excerpt length, even multi-sentence excerpts can fool expert human raters over 30% of the time. Our findings reveal the importance of using both human and automatic detectors to assess the humanness of text generation systems.\n4. 要解决什么问题\n机器生成的人声文本的检测。  \n5. 作者的主要贡献\n6. 得到了什么结果\n7. 关键字\n"},"ACL_2020/165.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/165.html","title":"2020.acl-main.165","keywords":"","body":"1.

However, this design lacks adaptation to individual domains. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-domain NMT model using individual modules for each domain, on which we apply word-level, adaptive and layer-wise domain mixing. We first observe that words in a sentence are often related to multiple domains. Hence, we assume each word has a domain proportion, which indicates its domain preference. Then word representations are obtained by mixing their embedding in individual domains based on their domain proportions. We show this can be achieved by carefully designing multi-head dot-product attention modules for different domains, and eventually taking weighted averages of their parameters by word-level layer-wise domain proportions. Through this, we can achieve effective domain knowledge sharing, and capture fine-grained domain-specific knowledge as well. Our experiments show that our proposed model outperforms existing ones in several NMT tasks.\n4. 要解决什么问题\nNMT需要大量标注的parallel sentences。但某些特定的领域没有足够多的parallel sentences。解决方法：  \n\n使用unparalleled数据集  \n训练一个多域的NMT，即把多个域的数据堆在一起，训练一个统一的模型。  \n\n多域NMT存在的问题：  \n\n数据足够的情况下，多域性能劣于单域  \n多域模型针对某个域fine-tune后，其它域性能变差。   \n\n多域NMT的改进：  \n\n实例加权，例如:（1）句子和domain分别加权（2）cost weighting（3）训练过程中动态选择和调整句子的权重。  \n特殊的encoder-decoder结构，例如：（1）domain-aware embedding + domain classifier（2）在embedding内划分domain-share和domain-specific知识（3）用评价机制使模型更关注domain-specific单词。  \n\n以上改进方法存在的问题：让一个encoder学习所有域通用的embedding，缺少针对特定域的适配。   \n5. 作者的主要贡献\n本文模型的特点：  \n\n一个多域的NMT模型，对每个域有一个对应的模块。  \n分析一个单词的域倾向，把域倾向结合到embedding中。  \nword-level，自适用，layer-wise的deomain融合。  \n\n原理：句子的domain不一定就是句子中单词的domain，因此希望 。。。 [?]没看懂  \n步骤：  \n\n根据内容为每个单词分配domain proportion  \nmulti-head点乘注意力机制，基于domain proportion捕获domain-shared/specific知识  \n把不同的modules混合  \n\n6. 得到了什么结果\n\n更擅长捕获domain-specific知识   \n更擅长domain知识共享  \n同时提升了所有domain的性能。  \n\n7. 关键字\n多域\n"},"ACL_2020/167.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/167.html","title":"2020.acl-main.167","keywords":"","body":"1.

This paper presents a new conversation generation model, ConceptFlow, which leverages commonsense knowledge graphs to explicitly model conversation flows. By grounding conversations to the concept space, ConceptFlow represents the potential conversation flow as traverses in the concept space along commonsense relations. The traverse is guided by graph attentions in the concept graph, moving towards more meaningful directions in the concept space, in order to generate more semantic and informative responses. Experiments on Reddit conversations demonstrate ConceptFlow’s effectiveness over previous knowledge-aware conversation models and GPT-2 based models while using 70% fewer parameters, confirming the advantage of explicit modeling conversation structures.

This information is typically represented as a semantic frame that captures the intent and slot-labels provided by the user. We first show that such a shallow representation is insufficient for complex dialog scenarios, because it does not capture the recursive nature inherent in many domains. We propose a recursive, hierarchical frame-based representation and show how to learn it from data. We formulate the frame generation task as a template-based tree decoding task, where the decoder recursively generates a template and then fills slot values into the template. We extend local tree-based loss functions with terms that provide global supervision and show how to optimize them end-to-end. We achieve a small improvement on the widely used ATIS dataset and a much larger improvement on a more complex dataset we describe here.    \n4. 要解决什么问题\nNatural Language Understanding (NLU) component基于用于输入生成的信息的表示不足以应对复杂的对话场景。     \n5. 作者的主要贡献\n基于输入信息生成一个recursive, hierarchical frame-based表示[?] 没看懂同时使用recursive的方法解码\n6. 得到了什么结果\n在ATIS数据集上有较小的进步。在更复杂的数据集上有较大的进步。\n7. 关键字\n"},"ACL_2020/201.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/201.html","title":"2020.acl-main.201","keywords":"","body":"1.

Recent CLWE methods use linear projections, which underfit the training dictionary, to generalize on BLI. However, underfitting can hinder generalization to other downstream tasks that rely on words from the training dictionary. We address this limitation by retrofitting CLWE to the training dictionary, which pulls training translation pairs closer in the embedding space and overfits the training dictionary. This simple post-processing step often improves accuracy on two downstream tasks, despite lowering BLI test accuracy. We also retrofit to both the training dictionary and a synthetic dictionary induced from CLWE, which sometimes generalizes even better on downstream tasks. Our results confirm the importance of fully exploiting the training dictionary in downstream tasks and explains why BLI is a flawed CLWE evaluation.\nCross-lingual word embeddings (CLWE)：跨语言单词嵌入bilingual lexicon induction (BLI): 双语词典推断hinder：阻碍retrofitting：改进  \n4. 要解决什么问题\n用线性映射做CLWE会导致欠拟合，会影响下游任务的泛化能力。  \n5. 作者的主要贡献\n让模型对训练词典过拟合。  \n6. 得到了什么结果\nBLI上准确率下降，但下游任务的泛化能力提升。  \n7. 关键字\n"},"ACL_2020/218.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/218.html","title":"2020.acl-main.218","keywords":"","body":"1.

Modern dialogue systems are not explicitly trained to build common ground, and therefore overlook this important aspect of communication. Improvisational theater (improv) intrinsically contains a high proportion of dialogue focused on building common ground, and makes use of the yes-and principle, a strong grounding speech act, to establish coherence and an actionable objective reality. We collect a corpus of more than 26,000 yes-and turns, transcribing them from improv dialogues and extracting them from larger, but more sparsely populated movie script dialogue corpora, via a bootstrapped classifier. We fine-tune chit-chat dialogue systems with our corpus to encourage more grounded, relevant conversation and confirm these findings with human evaluations.\nImprovisational theater:即兴表演场  \n4. 要解决什么问题\n对话的过程会建议大量的公共基础，这个公共基础很重要，却被忽视。\n5. 作者的主要贡献\n从即兴表演中收集了大数的数据，生成对话语料库。\n6. 得到了什么结果\n无\n7. 关键字\n"},"ACL_2020/219.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/219.html","title":"2020.acl-main.219","keywords":"","body":"1.

Communication grounded in images, whereby a dialogue is conducted based on a given photo, is a setup naturally appealing to humans (Hu et al., 2014). In this work we study large-scale architectures and datasets for this goal. We test a set of neural architectures using state-of-the-art image and text representations, considering various ways to fuse the components. To test such models, we collect a dataset of grounded human-human conversations, where speakers are asked to play roles given a provided emotional mood or style, as the use of such traits is also a key factor in engagingness (Guo et al., 2019). Our dataset, Image-Chat, consists of 202k dialogues over 202k images using 215 possible style traits. Automatic metrics and human evaluations of engagingness show the efficacy of our approach; in particular, we obtain state-of-the-art performance on the existing IGC task, and our best performing model is almost on par with humans on the ImageChat test set (preferred 47.7% of the time).\n4. 要解决什么问题\n模型需要捕获人的说话模式。  \n5. 作者的主要贡献\n生成基于图像的对话数据集。  \n6. 得到了什么结果\n模型结果优于IGC？[?] 这个论文好像没有设计模型？  \n7. 关键字\n"},"ACL_2020/221.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/221.html","title":"2020.acl-main.221","keywords":"","body":"1.

By multi-tasking on such a broad large-scale set of data, we hope to both move towards and measure progress in producing a single unified agent that can perceive, reason and converse with humans in an open-domain setting. We show that such multi-tasking improves over a BERT pretrained baseline, largely due to multi-tasking with very large dialogue datasets in a similar domain, and that the multi-tasking in general provides gains to both text and image-based tasks using several metrics in both the finetune and task transfer settings.

In particular, language models based on neural networks have improved the state of the art with regard to predictive language modeling, while topic models are successful at capturing clear-cut, semantic dimensions. In this paper, we explore how these approaches can be adapted and combined to model the linguistic and literary aspects needed for poetry generation. The system is exclusively trained on standard, non-poetic text, and its output is constrained in order to confer a poetic character to the generated verse. The framework is applied to the generation of poems in both English and French, and is equally evaluated for both languages. Even though it only uses standard, non-poetic text as input, the system yields state of the art results for poetry generation.\n4. 要解决什么问题\n5. 作者的主要贡献\n将语言模型、topic模型用于生成诗。\n6. 得到了什么结果\n生成英语诗和法语诗，得到SOTA的结果。  \n7. 关键字\n"},"ACL_2020/224.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/224.html","title":"2020.acl-main.224","keywords":"","body":"1.

Hence, popular sequence-to-sequence models, which require serialized input, are not a natural fit for this task. Graph neural networks, on the other hand, can better encode the input graph but broaden the structural gap between the encoder and decoder, making faithful generation difficult. To narrow this gap, we propose DUALENC, a dual encoding model that can not only incorporate the graph structure, but can also cater to the linear structure of the output text. Empirical comparisons with strong single-encoder baselines demonstrate that dual encoding can significantly improve the quality of the generated text.\n4. 要解决什么问题\nSeq2seq模型的encoder和decoder是相似的，但不能处理图像输入。Graph2seq模型可以处理图像输入，但是encoder和decoder的gap比较大。  \n5. 作者的主要贡献\nDUALENC：双向encoding模型，结合图像结构和线性结构。  \n6. 得到了什么结果\n比single-encoder性能好。  \n7. 关键字\n"},"ACL_2020/227.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/227.html","title":"2020.acl-main.227","keywords":"","body":"1.

We propose to extend this framework with a simple and effective post-generation ranking approach. Our framework (i) retrieves several potentially relevant outputs for each input, (ii) edits each candidate independently, and (iii) re-ranks the edited candidates to select the final output. We use a standard editing model with simple task-specific reranking approaches, and we show empirically that this approach outperforms existing, significantly more complex methodologies. Experiments on two machine translation (MT) datasets show new state-of-art results. We also achieve near state-of-art performance on the Gigaword summarization dataset, where our analyses show that there is significant room for performance improvement with better candidate output selection in future work.\n4. 要解决什么问题\n对Retrieve-and-edit框架的一些改进  \n5. 作者的主要贡献\nRetrieve-and-edit改为Retrieve-and-rerank对多个output做edit后综合其结果。  \n6. 得到了什么结果\n这种方法比更复杂的方法性能好。在两个MT数据集上得到了STOA的结果。在Gigaword summarization得到了接近SOTA的结果。  \n7. 关键字\nRetrieve-and-edit\n"},"ACL_2020/251.html":{"url":"ACL_2020/251.html","title":"2020.acl-main.251","keywords":"","body":"1.

The first focuses on utilizing high-resource languages to improve the quality of low-resource languages via multilingual NMT. The second direction employs monolingual data with selfsupervision to pre-train translation models, followed by fine-tuning on small amounts of supervised data. In this work, we join these two lines of research and demonstrate the efficacy of monolingual data with self-supervision in multilingual NMT. We offer three major results: (i) Using monolingual data significantly boosts the translation quality of lowresource languages in multilingual models. (ii) Self-supervision improves zero-shot translation quality in multilingual models.

We design an algorithm to achieve adaptive policies via a simple heuristic composition of a set of fixed policies. Experiments on Chinese→English and German→English show that our adaptive policies can outperform fixed ones by up to 4 BLEU points for the same latency, and more surprisingly, it even surpasses the BLEU score of full-sentence translation in the greedy mode (and very close to beam mode), but with much lower latency. \n4. 要解决什么问题\nSimultaneous translation(ST)的特点是：source sentence还没结束，翻译过程就已经开始。ST相对于全句翻译的难点是：翻译质量与延时之间的权衡。  \npolicy：翻译策略，决定每一步是READ还是WRITE。  \n已有的policy有：  \n\n把源分成几个trunk，用于SPEECH  \n一些简单的static rule，用于TEXT  \n根据已有信息动态计算，用于TEXT  \n\n已有的动态policy算法：  \n\n基于全句翻译模型，实时性不好  \n基于underlying翻译模型，翻译复杂  \n\n5. 作者的主要贡献\n本文的动态policy算法：\n    将固定策略以一种简单启发式的方法组合，得到动态策略算法。  \n6. 得到了什么结果\n\n实时翻译\nChinese→English and German→English    4 BLEU提升     在同样延时条件下  \n全句翻译\n优于grid search，低于beam search  \n\n7. 关键字\n"},"NANER/1.html":{"url":"NANER/1.html","title":"Neural Architectures for Named Entity Recognition","keywords":"","body":"\n[info]paper: http://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N16/N16-1030.pdfcode of the LSTM-CRF:https://github.com/glample/taggercode of the Stack-LSTM: https://github.com/clab/stack-lstm-ner  \n\nNeural Architectures for Named Entity Recognition\n\n[success]Name Entity Recognition， NER，命名实体识别问题https://blog.csdn.net/suoyan1539/article/details/79550889\n\n"},"NANER/Abstract.html":{"url":"NANER/Abstract.html","title":"Abstract","keywords":"","body":"1.

Introduction1. Introduction\nNamed entity recognition (NER) is a challenging learning problem. One the one hand, in most languages and domains, there is only a very small amount of supervised training data available. On the other, there are few constraints on the kinds of words that can be names, so generalizing from this small sample of data is difficult. As a result, carefully constructed orthographic features and language-specific knowledge resources, such as gazetteers, are widely used for solving this task.   \n\n[info]orthographic features：正交特征  \n\nUnfortunately, language-specific resources and features are costly to develop in new languages and new domains, making NER a challenge to adapt.

First, since names often consist of multiple tokens, reasoning jointly over tagging decisions for each token is important. We compare two models here, (i) a bidirectional LSTM with a sequential conditional random layer above it (LSTM-CRF; §2), and (ii) a new model that constructs and labels chunks of input sentences using an algorithm inspired by transition-based parsing with states represented by stack LSTMs (S-LSTM; §3).   \n\n[warning] 这一段没看懂？先验假设1：name都是多token的[?] reasoning jointly over tagging decisions for each token这句话是什么意思？[?] 这个先验假设与这两个模型是什么关系？  \n\nSecond, token-level evidence for “being a name” includes both orthographic evidence (what does the word being tagged as a name look like?) and distributional evidence (where does the word being tagged tend to occur in a corpus?).

LSTM - CRF Model1.1. LSTM1.2. CRF Tagging Models1.3. Parameterization and Training1.4. Tagging Schemes1. LSTM - CRF Model\nWe provide a brief description of LSTMs and CRFs, and present a hybrid tagging architecture. This architecture is similar to the ones presented by Collobert et al. (2011) and Huang et al. (2015).  \n1.1. LSTM\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a family of neural networks that operate on sequential data. They take as input a sequence of vectors (x 1 ,x 2 ,...,x n ) and return another sequence (h 1 ,h 2 ,...,h n ) that represents some information about the sequence at every step in the input. Although RNNs can, in theory, learn long dependencies, in practice they fail to do so and tend to be biased towards their most recent inputs in the sequence (Bengio et al., 1994). Long Short-term Memory Networks (LSTMs) have been designed to combat this issue by incorporating a memory-cell and have been shown to capture long-range dependencies. They do so using several gates that control the proportion of the input to give to the memory cell, and the proportion from the previous state to forget (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). We use the following implementation:\nit=σ(Wxixt+Whiht−1+Wcict−1+bi)ct=(1−it)⊙ct−1+it⊙tanh(Wxcxt+Whcht−1+bc)ot=σ(Wxoxt+Whoht−1+Wcoct+bo)ht=ot⊙tanh(ct)\n\\begin{aligned}\ni_t = \\sigma(W_{xi}x_t + W_{hi}h_{t-1} + W_{ci}c_{t-1} + b_i)  \\\\\nc_t = (1-i_t)\\odot c_{t-1} + i_t \\odot \\tanh(W_{xc}x_t + W_{hc}h_{t-1} + b_c)  \\\\\no_t = \\sigma(W_{xo}x_t + W_{ho}h_{t-1} + W_{co}c_t + b_o)   \\\\\nh_t = o_t \\odot \\tanh(c_t)\n\\end{aligned}\n​i​t​​=σ(W​xi​​x​t​​+W​hi​​h​t−1​​+W​ci​​c​t−1​​+b​i​​)​c​t​​=(1−i​t​​)⊙c​t−1​​+i​t​​⊙tanh(W​xc​​x​t​​+W​hc​​h​t−1​​+b​c​​)​o​t​​=σ(W​xo​​x​t​​+W​ho​​h​t−1​​+W​co​​c​t​​+b​o​​)​h​t​​=o​t​​⊙tanh(c​t​​)​​\n\n[success]LSTM的过程：  \n\n把xtx_txt​和ht−1h_{t-1}ht−1​合并成一个大的输入向量[xt,ht−1][x_t, h_{t-1}][xt​,ht−1​]   \n根据输入向量[xt,ht−1][x_t, h_{t-1}][xt​,ht−1​]和缓存状态Ct−1C_{t-1}Ct−1​计算gate  \ngate决定输入向量[xt,ht−1][x_t, h_{t-1}][xt​,ht−1​]和缓存状态Ct−1C_{t-1}Ct−1​各起多少作用，得到新的缓存状态CtC_tCt​  \n根据输入向量[xt,ht−1][x_t, h_{t-1}][xt​,ht−1​]和新的缓存状态CtC_tCt​计算另一个gate  \ngate决定有多个CtC_tCt​进入hth_tht​\n\n\nwhere σ is the element-wise sigmoid function, and ⊙\\odot⊙ is the element-wise product.\nFor a given sentence (x 1 ,x 2 ,...,x n ) containing n words, each represented as a d-dimensional vector, an LSTM computes a representation hth_tht​ of the left context of the sentence at every word t. Naturally, generating a representation of the right context hth_tht​ as well should add useful information. This can be achieved using a second LSTM that reads the same sequence in reverse. We will refer to the former as the forward LSTM and the latter as the backward LSTM. These are two distinct networks with different parameters. This forward and backward LSTM pair is referred to as a bidirectional LSTM (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005).  \nThe representation of a word using this model is obtained by concatenating its left and right context representations, ht=[ht;ht]h_t = [h_t;h_t]ht​=[ht​;ht​]. These representations effectively include a representation of a word in context, which is useful for numerous tagging applications.\n\n[success]输入向量序列x分别正向LSTM和反向LSTM得到向量ht1和向量ht2，ht1和ht2合并成一向量，称为h，是关于输入序列的some information  \n\n1.2.

Despite this model’s success in simple problems like POS tagging, its independent classification decisions are limiting when there are strong dependencies across output labels. NER is one such task, since the “grammar” that characterizes interpretable sequences of tags imposes several hard constraints (e.g., I-PER cannot follow B-LOC; see §2.4 for details) that would be impossible to model with independence assumptions.\n\n[success]由于output之间有strong dependency，不能直接根据hth_tht​预测yty_tyt​[?] Pos tagging\n\nTherefore, instead of modeling tagging decisions independently, we model them jointly using a conditional random field (Lafferty et al., 2001).   \n\n[success]解决方法：\n使用CRF做tagging决定“jointly”\n\nFor an input sentence\nX=(x1,x2,⋯,xn),\nX = (x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_n),\nX=(x​1​​,x​2​​,⋯,x​n​​),\nwe consider P to be the matrix of scores output by the bidirectional LSTM network.

Instead of using the softmax output from this layer, we use a CRF as previously described to take into account neighboring tags, yielding the final predictions for every word yi .  \n\n[success]CRF层代替softmax层来产生结果。  \n\nAdditionally, we observed that adding a hidden layer between c i and the CRF layer marginally improved our results.

Tagging Schemes\nThe task of named entity recognition is to assign a named entity label to every word in a sentence. A single named entity could span several tokens within a sentence. Sentences are usually represented in the IOB format (Inside, Outside, Beginning) where every token is labeled as B-label if the token is the beginning of a named entity, I-label if it is inside a named entity but not the first token within the named entity, or O otherwise.   \n\n[success] IOB formatB: token是name entity的第一个单词I：token是name entity的一部分，但不是第一个单词O：token不是name entity\n\nHowever, we decided to use the IOBES tagging scheme, a variant of IOB commonly used for named entity recognition, which encodes information about singleton entities (S) and explicitly marks the end of named entities (E).   \n\n[success] IOBES tagging schemeB: token是name entity的第一个单词I：token是name entity的一部分，但不是第一个单词，也不是最后一个单词。E：token是name entity的最后一个单词S：token是name entity，且name entity只包含这一个tokenO：token不是name entity\n\nUsing this scheme, tagging a word as I-label with high-confidence narrows down the choices for the subsequent word to I-label or E-label, however, the IOB scheme is only capable of determining that the subsequent word cannot be the interior of another label. Ratinov and Roth (2009) and Dai et al. (2015) showed that using a more expressive tagging scheme like IOBES improves model performance marginally. However, we did not observe a significant improvement over the IOB tagging scheme.\n\n[success]本文使用IOBES代替IOB理论上IOBES能提升性能，实际没有发现明显地提升。  \n\n"},"NANER/Chunking.html":{"url":"NANER/Chunking.html","title":"3 Transition-Based Chunking Model","keywords":"","body":"1.

Chunking Algorithm\nWe designed a transition inventory which is given in Figure 2 that is inspired by transition-based parsers, in particular the arc-standard parser of Nivre (2004).   \n\n[info]transition inventory：过滤库存[?] arc-standard parser\n\n  \nIn this algorithm, we make use of two stacks (designated output and stack representing, respectively, completed chunks and scratch space) and a buffer that contains the words that have yet to be processed.   \n\n[success] 算法所使用的数据结构：output： 栈结构，用于chunk spacestack： 栈结构，用于scrach spacebuffer： buffer结构，用于存放没有处理的word  \n\nThe transition inventory contains the following transitions: The SHIFT transition moves a word from the buffer to the stack, the OUT transition moves a word from the buffer directly into the output stack while the REDUCE (y) transition pops all items from the top of the stack creating a “chunk,” labels this with label y, and pushes a representation of this chunk onto the output stack.   \n\n[success] 算法提供的基于数据结构的操作：SHIFT： buffer -> stackOUT: buffer -> outputREDUCE: pop, label for all, -> output  \n\nThe algorithm completes when the stack and buffer are both empty. The algorithm is depicted in Figure 2, which shows the sequence of operations required to process the sentence Mark Watney visited Mars.\nThe model is parameterized by defining a probability distribution over actions at each time step, given the current contents of the stack, buffer, and output, as well as the history of actions taken. Following Dyer et al. (2015), we use stack LSTMs to compute a fixed dimensional embedding of each of these, and take a concatenation of these to obtain the full algorithm state. This representation is used to define a distribution over the possible actions that can be taken at each time step. The model is trained to maximize the conditional probability of sequences of reference actions (extracted from a la-\nbeled training corpus) given the input sentences.  \n\n[success]训练阶段的目标：基于以下信息（条件）计算出每个action的概率（条件概率）（1）当前stack中的信息（2）当前output中的信息（3）当前buffer中的信息（4）action历史使用LSTM将以上内容向量化为固定长度的embedding，用于下一步计算概率。结束：stack为空，buffer为空。根据“output, stack, buffer, 操作历史”，决定“这一次采取某个操作的概率”。  \n\nTo label a new input sequence at test time, the maximum probability action is chosen greedily until the algorithm reaches a termination state. Although this is not guaranteed to find a global optimum, it is effective in practice.   \n\n[success]测试阶段使用贪心算法选择当前时刻的Action。即只考虑使当前时间概率最大的Action，而不考虑整体上概率最大的Action序列。  \n\nSince each token is either moved directly to the output (1 action) or first to the stack and then the output (2 actions), the total number of actions for a sequence of length n is maximally 2n.\nIt is worth noting that the nature of this algorithm model makes it agnostic to the tagging scheme used since it directly predicts labeled chunks.  \n\n[warning] [?]这一段没看懂\n\n1.2. Representing Labeled Chunks\nWhen the REDUCE (y) operation is executed, the algorithm shifts a sequence of tokens (together with their vector embeddings) from the stack to the output buffer as a single completed chunk. To compute an embedding of this sequence, we run a bidirectional LSTM over the embeddings of its constituent tokens together with a token representing the type of the chunk being identified (i.e., y). This function is given as g(u,...,v,r y ), where r y is a learned embedding of a label type. Thus, the output buffer contains a single vector representation for each labeled chunk that is generated, regardless of its length.\n\n[success]REDUCE时用双向RNN分析这组词的label。  \n\n"},"NANER/Embedding.html":{"url":"NANER/Embedding.html","title":"4 Input Word Embeddings","keywords":"","body":"1. Input Word Embeddings1.1. Character-based models of words1.2. Pretrained embeddings1.3. 4.3 Dropout training1. Input Word Embeddings\nThe input layers to both of our models are vector representations of individual words. Learning independent representations for word types from the limited NER training data is a difficult problem: there are simply too many parameters to reliably estimate. Since many languages have orthographic or morphological evidence that something is a name (or not a name), we want representations that are sensitive to the spelling of words. We therefore use a model that constructs representations of words from representations of the characters they are composed of (4.1).   \n\n[success]先验知识1：可以从一个单词的组成推断它是不是一个name entity。因此使用字符级双向LSTM来体现单词组成的特点。  \n\nOur second intuition is that names, which may individually be quite varied, appear in regular contexts in large corpora. Therefore we use embeddings learned from a large corpus that are sensitive to word order (4.2).   \n\n[success]先验知识2：可以从一个单词在句子上的位置推断它是不是一个name entity。因此使用对单词顺序敏感的语料库训练embedding.  \n\nFinally, to prevent the models from depending on one representation or the other too strongly, we use dropout training and find this is crucial for good generalization performance (4.3).\n\n[success]dropout用于平衡字符级表示与单词级表示的重要性，对性能有很大提升。  \n\n1.1. Character-based models of words\nAn important distinction of our work from most previous approaches is that we learn character-level features while training instead of hand-engineering prefix and suffix information about words. Learning character-level embeddings has the advantage of learning representations specific to the task and do main at hand. They have been found useful for morphologically rich languages and to handle the out-of-vocabulary problem for tasks like part-of-speech tagging and language modeling (Ling et al., 2015b) or dependency parsing (Ballesteros et al., 2015).  \n\n[success] 字符级的embedding的优势形态学rich的语言处理out of vocabulary问题dependency parsing  \n\nFigure 4 describes our architecture to generate a word embedding for a word from its characters. A character lookup table initialized at random contains an embedding for every character. The character embeddings corresponding to every character in a word are given in direct and reverse order to a forward and a backward LSTM. The embedding for a word derived from its characters is the concatenation of its forward and backward representations from the bidirectional LSTM. This character-level representation is then concatenated with a word-level representation from a word lookup-table. During testing, words that do not have an embedding in the lookup table are mapped to a UNK embedding.   \n  \n\n[success] \n字符级embedding也是用的双向LSTM，然后两边的结果拼到一起。区别是每个LSTM都是在一个单词结束时才输出。再加上单词级的embedding，来自查表和UNK embedding\n\nTo train the UNK embedding, we replace singletons with the UNK embedding with a probability 0.5.   \n\n[warning] 这一句没看懂  \n\nIn all our experiments, the hidden dimension of the forward and backward character LSTMs are 25 each, which results in our character-based representation of words being of dimension 50.  \nRecurrent models like RNNs and LSTMs are capable of encoding very long sequences, however, they have a representation biased towards their most recent inputs. As a result, we expect the final representation of the forward LSTM to be an accurate representation of the suffix of the word, and the final state of the backward LSTM to be a better representation of its prefix.  \n\n[success]\n为什么用双向LSTM？因为RNN/LSTM受最近的点影响特别大。双向分别用于识别单词的前缀和后缀。\n\nAlternative approaches most notably like convolutional networks—have been proposed to learn representations of words from their characters (Zhang et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015). However, convnets are designed to discover position-invariant features of their inputs. While this is appropriate for many problems, e.g., image recognition (a cat can appear anywhere in a picture), we argue that important information is position dependent (e.g., prefixes and suffixes encode different information than stems), making LSTMs an a priori better function class for modeling the relationship between words and their characters.  \n\n[success]\n此处不适合用CNN，因为前缀和后缀的位置固定，不具有平移不变性。\n\n1.2. Pretrained embeddings\nAs in Collobert et al. (2011), we use pretrained word embeddings to initialize our lookup table. We observe significant improvements using pretrained word embeddings over randomly initialized ones.  \n\n[success]图4的单词级look-up table的初始化，使用pretrained代替随机初始化，性能有明显提升。  \n\nEmbeddings are pretrained using skip-n-gram (Ling et al., 2015a), a variation of word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013a) that accounts for word order. These embeddings are fine-tuned during training.  \n\n[success]look-up-table = skip-n-gram + fine-tuned   \n\nWord embeddings for Spanish, Dutch, German and English are trained using the Spanish Gigaword version 3, the Leipzig corpora collection, the German monolingual training data from the 2010 Machine Translation Workshop and the English Giga word version 4 (with the LA Times and NY Times portions removed) respectively. 2 We use an embedding dimension of 100 for English, 64 for other languages, a minimum word frequency cutoff of 4, and a window size of 8.\n\n[success] 训练word embedding用的语料库\n\n1.3. 4.3 Dropout training\nInitial experiments showed that character-level embeddings did not improve our overall performance when used in conjunction with pretrained word representations. To encourage the model to depend on both representations, we use dropout training (Hinton et al., 2012), applying a dropout mask to the final embedding layer just before the input to the bidirectional LSTM in Figure 1. We observe a significant improvement in our model’s performance after using dropout (see table 5).\n\n[success]字符级表示 + 单词级表示 + pretrained = 效果一般字符级表示 + 单词级表示 + pretrained + dropout = 效果好  \n\n"},"NANER/Experiments.html":{"url":"NANER/Experiments.html","title":"5 Experiments","keywords":"","body":"1. 5 Experiments1.1. 5.1 Training1.2. 5.2 Data Sets1.3. 5.3 Results1.4. 5.4 Network architectures1. 5 Experiments\nThis section presents the methods we use to train our models, the results we obtained on various tasks and the impact of our networks’ configuration on model\nperformance.\n1.1. 5.1 Training\nFor both models presented, we train our networks using the back-propagation algorithm updating our parameters on every training example, one at a time, using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.01 and a gradient clipping of 5.0.   \n\n[warning] \none at a time的意思是on-line算法？  \n\nSeveral methods have been proposed to enhance the performance of SGD, such as Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012) or Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014). Although we observe faster convergence using these methods, none of them perform as well as SGD with gradient clipping.  \n\n[success]sgd的加速算法虽然收敛更快，但结果不如sgd+clipping  \n\nOur LSTM-CRF model uses a single layer for the forward and backward LSTMs whose dimensions are set to 100. Tuning this dimension did not significantly impact model performance. We set the dropout rate to 0.5. Using higher rates negatively impacted our results, while smaller rates led to longer training time.  \n\n[success]dropout rate:大 --> 性能变差小 --> 收敛变慢\n\nThe stack-LSTM model uses two layers each of dimension 100 for each stack. The embeddings of the actions used in the composition functions have 16 dimensions each, and the output embedding is of dimension 20. We experimented with different dropout rates and reported the scores using the best dropout rate for each language. 3 It is a greedy model that apply locally optimal actions until the entire sentence is processed, further improvements might be obtained with beam search (Zhang and Clark, 2011) or training with exploration (Ballesteros et al., 2016).\n1.2. 5.2 Data Sets\nWe test our model on different datasets for named entity recognition. To demonstrate our model’s ability to generalize to different languages, we present results on the CoNLL-2002 and CoNLL-2003 datasets (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) that contain independent named entity labels for English, Spanish, German and Dutch. All datasets contain four different types of named entities: locations, persons, organizations, and miscellaneous entities that do not belong in any of the three previous categories. Although POS tags were made available for all datasets, we did not include them in our models. We did not perform any dataset preprocessing, apart from replacing every digit with a zero in the English NER dataset.  \n1.3. 5.3 Results\nTable 1 presents our comparisons with other models for named entity recognition in English. To make the comparison between our model and others fair, we report the scores of other models with and without the use of external labeled data such as gazetteers and knowledge bases. Our models do not use gazetteers or any external labeled resources. The best score reported on this task is by Luo et al. (2015). They obtained a F 1 of 91.2 by jointly modeling the NER and entity linking tasks (Hoffart et al., 2011). Their model uses a lot of hand-engineered features including spelling features, WordNet clusters, Brown clusters, POS tags, chunks tags, as well as stemming and external knowledge bases like Freebase and Wikipedia. Our LSTM-CRF model outperforms all other systems, including the ones using external labeled data like gazetteers. Our Stack-LSTM model also outperforms all previous models that do not incorporate external features, apart from the one presented by Chiu and Nichols (2015).\nTables 2, 3 and 4 present our results on NER for German, Dutch and Spanish respectively in comparison to other models. On these three languages, the LSTM-CRF model significantly out performs all previous methods, including the ones using external labeled data. The only exception is Dutch, where the model of Gillick et al. (2015) can perform better by leveraging the information from other NER datasets. The Stack-LSTM also consistently presents state-the-art (or close to) results compared to systems that do not use external data.\nAs we can see in the tables, the Stack-LSTM model is more dependent on character-based representations to achieve competitive performance; we hypothesize that the LSTM-CRF model requires less orthographic information since it gets more contextual information out of the bidirectional LSTMs; however, the Stack-LSTM model consumes the words one by one and it just relies on the word representations when it chunks words.\n1.4. 5.4 Network architectures\nOur models had several components that we could tweak to understand their impact on the overall performance.  \n\n[info] tweak：微调  \n\nWe explored the impact that the CRF, the character-level representations, pretraining of our word embeddings and dropout had on our LSTM-CRF model. We observed that pretraining our word embeddings gave us the biggest improvement in overall performance of +7.31 in F 1 . The CRF layer gave us an increase of +1.79, while using dropout resulted in a difference of +1.17 and finally learning character-level word embeddings resulted in an increase of about +0.74. For the Stack-LSTM we performed a similar set of experiments.

Related Work1. Related Work\nIn the CoNLL-2002 shared task, Carreras et al. (2002) obtained among the best results on both Dutch and Spanish by combining several small fixed-depthdecisiontrees. Nextyear, in the CoNLL-2003 Shared Task, Florian et al. (2003) obtained the best score on German by combining the output of four diverse classifiers. Qi et al. (2009) later improved on this with a neural network by doing unsupervised learning on a massive unlabeled corpus.\nSeveral other neural architectures have previously been proposed for NER. For instance, Collobert et al. (2011) uses a CNN over a sequence of word embeddings with a CRF layer on top. This can be thought of as our first model without character-level embeddings and with the bidirectional LSTM being replaced by a CNN. More recently, Huang et al. (2015) presented a modelsimilar to our LSTM-CRF, but using hand-crafted spelling features. Zhou and Xu (2015) also used a similar model and adapted it to the semantic role labeling task. Lin and Wu (2009) used a linear chain CRF with L 2 regularization, they added phrase cluster features extracted from the web data and spelling features. Passos et al. (2014) also used a linear chain CRF with spelling features and gazetteers.\nLanguage independent NER models like ours have also been proposed in the past. Cucerzan 267 and Yarowsky (1999; 2002) present semi-supervised bootstrapping algorithms for named entity recognition by co-training character-level (word-internal) and token-level (context) features. Eisenstein et al. (2011) use Bayesian nonparametrics to construct a database of named entities in an almost unsupervised setting. Ratinov and Roth (2009) quantitatively compare several approaches for NER and build their own supervised model using a regularized average perceptron and aggregating context information.\nFinally, there is currently a lot of interest in models for NER that use letter-based representations. Gillick et al. (2015) model the task of sequence-labeling as a sequence to sequence learning problem and incorporate character-based representations into their encoder model. Chiu and Nichols (2015) employ an architecture similar to ours, but instead use CNNs to learn character-level features, in a way similar to the work by Santos and Guimar˜ aes (2015).\n"},"NANER/Conclusion.html":{"url":"NANER/Conclusion.html","title":"7 Conclusion","keywords":"","body":"1. Conclusion2. Acknowledgments1. Conclusion\nThis paper presents two neural architectures for sequence labeling that provide the best NER results ever reported in standard evaluation settings, even compared with models that use external resources, such as gazetteers.\nA key aspect of our models are that they model output label dependencies, either via a simple CRF architecture, or using a transition-based algorithm to explicitly construct and label chunks of the input. Word representations are also crucially important for success: we use both pre-trained word representations and “character-based” representations that capture morphological and orthographic information. To prevent the learner from depending too heavily on one representation class, dropout is used.\n2.

Traditional approaches to machine reading and comprehension have been based on either hand engineered grammars[1], or information extraction methods of detecting predicate argument triples that can later be queried as a relational database [2].   \n\n[success] 常见的阅读理解模型训练方法：（1）hand engineered grammars（2）information extraction methods  \n\nSupervised machine learning approaches have largely been absent from this space due\nto both the lack of large scale training datasets, and the difficulty in structuring statistical models flexible enough to learn to exploit document structure.  \n\n[success]常见方法都是基于非监督学习的，因为可用于监督学习的数据太少。  \n\nWhile obtaining supervised natural language reading comprehension data has proved difficult, some researchers have explored generating synthetic narratives and queries [3, 4].   \n\n[info]synthetic：合成的narratives：叙述  \n\nSuch approaches allow the generation of almost unlimited amounts of supervised data and enable researchers to isolate the performance of their algorithms on individual simulated phenomena. Work on such data has shown that neural network based models hold promise for modelling reading comprehension, something that we will build upon here. Historically, however, many similar approaches in Computational Linguistics have failed to manage the transition from synthetic data to real environments, as such\nclosed worlds inevitably fail to capture the complexity, richness, and noise of natural language [5].  \n\n[success]Computational Linguistics：计算机语言生成监督数据的方法1：生成synthetic narratives and queries优点：（1）无限制的supervised data（2）让算法性能与实验环境解耦（3）让基于NN的阅读理解模型hold promise缺点：在合成数据上工作很好的模型，无法用于真实环境。因为自然语言的complexity, richness, noise。  \n\nIn this work we seek to directly address the lack of real natural language training data by introducing a novel approach to building a supervised reading comprehension data set. We observe that summary and paraphrase sentences, with their associated documents, can be readily converted to context–query–answer triples using simple entity detection and anonymisation algorithms.   \n\n[success]paraphrase：改述readily：便利地anonymisation：匿名生成监督数据的方法2（本文推荐的方法）：基于文章对应的summary and paraphrase生成(context, query, answer)元组。  \n\nUsing this approach we have collected two new corpora of roughly a million news stories with associated queries from the CNN and Daily Mail websites.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of our new corpora by building novel deep learning models for reading comprehension.   \n\n[success]efficacy：功效问：怎么证明生成的labelled data对训练阅读理解模型有帮助？答：使用基于些labelled data的监督学习模型的训练结果优于使用原始数据的非监督数据的结果。  \n\nThese models draw on recent developments for incorporating attention mechanisms into recurrent neural network architectures [6, 7, 8, 4]. This allows a model to focus on the aspects of a document that it believes will help it answer a question, and also allows us to visualises its inference process.   \n\n[success]基于labelled data的监督学习模型：RNN + 注意力机制  \n\nWe compare these neural models to a range of baselines and heuristic benchmarks based upon a traditional frame semantic analysis provided by a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) pipeline.   \n\n[success]benchmarks：基准点frame semantic analysis：框架语义分析问：baseline VS benchmarks答：一个算法被称为baseline，基本上表示比这个算法性能还差的基本上不能接受的，除非方法上有革命性的创新点，而且还有巨大的改进空间和超越benchmark的潜力，只是因为是发展初期而性能有限。所以baseline有一个自带的含义就是“性能起点”。benchmark一般是和同行中比较牛的算法比较，比牛算法还好，那你可以考虑发好一点的会议/期刊；baseline一般是自己算法优化和调参过程中自己和自己比较，目标是越来越好，当性能超过benchmark时，可以发表了，当性能甚至超过SOTA时，恭喜你，考虑投顶会顶刊啦。基于原始数据的非监督学习模型：a traditional frame semantic analysis provided by a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) pipeline。  \n\nOur results indicate that the neural models achieve a higher accuracy, and do so\nwithout any specific encoding of the document or query structure.\n"},"TMRC/Supervised.html":{"url":"TMRC/Supervised.html","title":"2 Supervised training data for reading comprehension","keywords":"","body":"1. Supervised training data for reading comprehension1.1. 2.1 Entity replacement and permutation1. Supervised training data for reading comprehension\nThe reading comprehension task naturally lends itself to a formulation as a supervised learning problem.  \n\n[info] formulation：公式化的  \n\nSpecifically we seek to estimate the conditional probability p(a|c,q), where c is a context document, q a query relating to that document, and a the answer to that query.  \n\n[success]目标是估计：p(a∣c,q)p(a|c, q)p(a∣c,q)a是回答，c是文本，q是问题  \n\nFor a focused evaluation we wish to be able to exclude additional information, such as world knowledge gained from co-occurrence statistics, in order to test a model’s core capability to detect and understand the linguistic relationships between entities in the context document.  \n\n[success]co-occurrence statistics：同现统计本文对阅读理解模型的评价方法：不关注从“同现统计”中获得的world knowledge，只关注entity之间的语言关系。  \n\nSuch an approach requires a large training corpus of document–query–answer triples and until now such corpora have been limited to hundreds of examples and thus mostly of use only for testing [9]. This limitation has meant that most work in this area has taken the form of unsupervised approaches which use templates or syntactic/semantic analysers to extract relation tuples from the document to form a knowledge graph that can be queried.\n\n[success]在labelled data不足的情况下，通常用labelled data作为测试，用unlabelled data作为非监督模型的训练。非监督模型的训练方法：使用“template”或“syntactic/semantic”分析器提取“元组关系”构建“知识图谱”  \n\nHere we propose a methodology for creating real-world, large scale supervised training data for learning reading comprehension models. Inspired by work in summarisation [10, 11], we create two machine reading corpora by exploiting online newspaper articles and their matching summaries.  \n\n[info] summarisation：摘要  \n\nWe have collected 93k articles from the CNN 1 and 220k articles from the Daily Mail 2 websites. Both news providers supplement their articles with a number of bullet points, summarising aspects of the information contained in the article.   \n\n[info] bullet points：关键词  \n\nOf key importance is that these summary points are abstractive and do not simply copy sentences from the documents.   \n\n[success]本文方法所需要的资源：（1）原始文本（2）文本对应的关键词（3）文本对应的摘要。  \n\nWe construct a corpus of document–query–answer triples by turning these bullet points into Cloze [12] style questions by replacing one entity at a time with a placeholder.  \n\n[success]本文提供的资源处理的过程：（1）turning these bullet points into Cloze（2）replacing one entity at a time with a placeholder得到的结果：document–query–answer triples  \n\nThis results in a combined corpus of roughly 1M data points (Table 1). Code to replicate our datasets—and to apply this method to other sources—is available online 3 .\n1.1. 2.1 Entity replacement and permutation\n\n[success]permutation：排列这一节的目的：去掉world knowledge，保留entity之间的关系  \n\nNote that the focus of this paper is to provide a corpus for evaluating a model’s ability to read and comprehend a single document, not world knowledge or co-occurrence. To understand that distinction consider for instance the following Cloze form queries (created from headlines in the Daily Mail validation set): a) The hi-tech bra that helps you beat breast X; b) Could Saccharin help beat X ?; c) Can fish oils help fight prostate X ? An ngram language model trained on the Daily Mail\nwould easily correctly predict that (X = cancer), regardless of the contents of the context document, simply because this is a very frequently cured entity in the Daily Mail corpus.\n\n[success]用一个例子说明“world knowledge”和“entity之间的关系”的区别。问题中的X代表Cloze中要填的空。  \n\nTo prevent such degenerate solutions and create a focused task we anonymise and randomise our corpora with the following procedure, a) use a coreference system to establish coreferents in each data point; b) replace all entities with abstract entity markers according to coreference; c) randomly permute these entity markers whenever a data point is loaded.  \n\n[info]degenerate：退化coreference system：[?]共指系统coreference：参照物[?] 上面三步的过程不是太懂  \n\nCompare the original and anonymised version of the example in Table 3. Clearly a human reader can answer both queries correctly. However in the anonymised setup the context document is required for answering the query, whereas the original version could also be answered by someone with the requisite background knowledge. Therefore, following this procedure, the only remaining strategy for answering questions is to do so by exploiting the context presented with each question. Thus performance on our two corpora truly measures reading comprehension capability. Naturally a production system would benefit from using all available information sources, such as clues through language and co-occurrence statistics.  \n  \n\n[success] anonymise and randomise的好处：只有读懂了文本才能回答，与先验无关，因此能衡量model是不是真的读懂了文本\n\nTable 2 gives an indication of the difficulty of the task, showing how frequent the correct answer is contained in the top N entity markers in a given document.

Models1.1. Symbolic Matching Models1.2. Neural Network Models1. Models\nSo far we have motivated the need for better datasets and tasks to evaluate the capabilities of machine reading models.  \n\n[success]motivated：激发目标：better datasets and tasks  \n\nWe proceed by describing a number of baselines, benchmarks and new models to evaluate against this paradigm. We define two simple baselines, the majority baseline (maximum frequency) picks the entity most frequently observed in the context document, whereas the exclusive majority (exclusive frequency) chooses the entity most frequently observed in the context but not observed in the query. The idea behind this exclusion is that the placeholder is unlikely to be mentioned twice in a single Cloze form query.  \n\n[success]baseline 1：maximum frequency，选择文本中频率最高的entitybaseline 2：exclusive frequency，选择文本中频率最高且没有在query中出现的entity  \n\n1.1. Symbolic Matching Models\nTraditionally, a pipeline of NLP models has been used for attempting question answering, that is models that make heavy use of linguistic annotation, structured world knowledge and semantic parsing and similar NLP pipeline outputs.  \n\n[success]annotation：注释传统方法所依据的东西：linguistic annotation, structured world knowledge and semantic parsing  \n\nBuilding on these approaches, we define a number of NLP-centric models for our machine reading task.  \nFrame-Semantic Parsing Frame-semantic parsing attempts to identify predicates and their arguments, allowing models access to information about “who did what to whom”.   \n\n[success]predicate：述语，谓语argument：论点框架语言分析的目标：提取出“who did what to whom”  \n\nNaturally this kind of annotation lends itself to being exploited for question answering. We develop a benchmark that makes use of frame-semantic annotations which we obtained by parsing our model with a state-of-the-art frame-semantic parser [13, 14].   \n\n[success] 使用state-of-the-art frame-semantic parser作为benchmark  \n\nAs the parser makes extensive use of linguistic information we run these benchmarks on the unanonymised version of our corpora. There is no significant advantage in this as the frame-semantic approach used here does not possess the capability to generalise through a language model beyond exploiting one during the parsing phase. Thus, the key objective of evaluating machine comprehension abilities is maintained.   \n\n[success]这个benchmark要求使用原始数据，而不是2.1中提供的anonymised数据。但是由于benchmark不能“generalise through a language model”，让benchmark使用原始数据不影响比较的公平性。  \n\nExtracting entity-predicate triples—denoted as (e 1 ,V,e 2 )—from both the query q and context document d, we attempt to resolve queries using a number of rules with an increasing recall/precision trade-off as follows (Table 4).  \n\n[success]benchmark具体做的事情：（1）从问题中提取三元组(p, V, y)（2）从文本中提取三元组(x, V, y)（3）x是p的候选答案，基于策略选择合适的x（4）recall/precision trade-off\n\nFor reasons of clarity, we pretend that all PropBank triples are of the form (e 1 ,V,e 2 ). In practice, we take the argument numberings of the parser into account and only compare like with like, except in cases such as the permuted frame rule, where ordering is relaxed. In the case of multiple possible answers from a single rule, we randomly choose one.\n\n[warning] 这一段没看懂  \n\nWord Distance Benchmark We consider another baseline that relies on word distance measurements. Here, we align the placeholder of the Cloze form question with each possible entity in the context document and calculate a distance measure between the question and the context around the aligned entity. This score is calculated by summing the distances of every word in q to their nearest aligned word in d, where alignment is defined by matching words either directly or as aligned by the coreference system. We tune the maximum penalty per word (m = 8) on the validation data.\n\n[success]for each entity：（1）把entity代入cloze中（2）计算文本中entity的附近单词和问题中entity的附近单词的距离[?]distance怎么算没看懂  \n\n1.2. Neural Network Models\nNeural networks have successfully been applied to a range of tasks in NLP. This includes classification tasks such as sentiment analysis [15] or POS tagging [16], as well as generative problems such as language modelling or machine translation [17].   \n\n[info] sentiment：情感  \n\nWe propose three neural models for estimating the probability of word type a from document d answering query q:  \np(a∣d,q)∝exp(W(a)g(d,q)),s.t.a∈V,\np(a|d,q) \\propto \\exp(W(a)g(d,q)), s.t. a \\in V,\np(a∣d,q)∝exp(W(a)g(d,q)),s.t.a∈V,\nwhere V is the vocabulary 4 , and W(a) indexes row a of weight matrix W and through a slight abuse of notation word types double as indexes. Note that we do not privilege entities or variables, the model must learn to differentiate these in the input sequence. The function g(d,q) returns a vector embedding of a document and query pair.  \n\n[success]这个公式不是太懂，可能意思是：g是vector embedding，代表文本和问题之间的联系点W是权重矩阵，代表某个单词在这些联系点上的权重。  \n\nThe Deep LSTM Reader Long short-term memory (LSTM, [18]) networks have recently seen considerable success in tasks such as machine translation and language modelling [17]. When used for translation, Deep LSTMs [19] have shown a remarkable ability to embed long sequences into a vector representation which contains enough information to generate a full translation in another language.   \n\n[success] Deep LSTM的特点：（1）embed long sequences into a vector（2）包含原序列的信息（3）用另一种形式表达信息  \n\nOur first neural model for reading comprehension tests the ability of Deep LSTM encoders to handle significantly longer sequences. We feed our documents one word at a time into a Deep LSTM encoder, after a delimiter we then also feed the query into the encoder.   \n\n[info] delimiter：划界符  \n\nAlternatively we also experiment with processing the query then the document.  \n  \n\n[success]把Deep LSTM当作一个encoder来用。输入可以是“文本+问题”或“问题+文本”。  \n\nThe result is that this model processes each document query pair as a single long sequence. Given the embedded document and query the network predicts which token in the document answers the query. \nWe employ a Deep LSTM cell with skip connections from each input x(t) to every hidden layer, and from every hidden layer to the output y(t):  \n\n[warning] \n[?] skip connections?确实没有hidden layer到y的输出，但是x到hidden layer的输出还是有的呀？  \n\nx′(t,k)=x(t)∣∣y′(t,k−1)y(t)=y′(t,1)∣∣...∣∣y′(t,K)i(t,k)=σ(Wkxix′(t,k)+Wkhih(t−1,k)+Wkcic(t−1,k)+bki)f(t,k)=σ(Wkxfx(t)+Wkhfh(t−1,k)+Wkcfc(t−1,k)+bkf)c(t,k)=f(t,k)c(t−1,k)+i(t,k)tanh(Wkxcx′(t,k)+Wkhch(t−1,k)+bkc)o(t,k)=σ(Wkxox′(t,k)+Wkhoh(t−1,k)+Wkcoc(t,k)+bko)h(t,k)=o(t,k)tanh(c(t,k))y′(t,k)=Wkyh(t,k)+bky\n\\begin{aligned}\nx'(t,k) &=& x(t)||y'(t,k-1) \\\\\ny(t) &=& y'(t,1)||...||y'(t,K) \\\\\ni(t,k) &=& \\sigma (W_{kxi} x'(t,k) + W_{khi} h(t - 1,k) + W_{kci} c(t - 1,k) + b_{ki} )  \\\\\nf(t,k) &=& \\sigma (W_{kxf} x(t) + W_{khf} h(t - 1,k) + W_{kcf} c(t - 1,k) + b_{kf} )  \\\\\nc(t,k) &=& f(t,k)c(t - 1,k) + i(t,k)\\tanh(W_{kxc} x'(t,k) + W_{khc} h(t - 1,k) + b_{kc} )  \\\\\no(t,k) &=& \\sigma (W_{kxo} x'(t,k) + W_{kho} h(t - 1,k) + W_{kco} c(t,k) + b_{ko} ) \\\\\nh(t,k) &=& o(t,k)\\tanh(c(t,k)) \\\\\ny'(t,k) &=& W_{ky} h(t,k) + b_{ky}\n\\end{aligned}\n​x​′​​(t,k)​y(t)​i(t,k)​f(t,k)​c(t,k)​o(t,k)​h(t,k)​y​′​​(t,k)​​​=​=​=​=​=​=​=​=​​​x(t)∣∣y​′​​(t,k−1)​y​′​​(t,1)∣∣...∣∣y​′​​(t,K)​σ(W​kxi​​x​′​​(t,k)+W​khi​​h(t−1,k)+W​kci​​c(t−1,k)+b​ki​​)​σ(W​kxf​​x(t)+W​khf​​h(t−1,k)+W​kcf​​c(t−1,k)+b​kf​​)​f(t,k)c(t−1,k)+i(t,k)tanh(W​kxc​​x​′​​(t,k)+W​khc​​h(t−1,k)+b​kc​​)​σ(W​kxo​​x​′​​(t,k)+W​kho​​h(t−1,k)+W​kco​​c(t,k)+b​ko​​)​o(t,k)tanh(c(t,k))​W​ky​​h(t,k)+b​ky​​​​\nwhere || indicates vector concatenation h(t,k) is the hidden state for layer k at time t, and i, f, o are the input, forget, and output gates respectively.

The representation r of the document d is formed by a weighted sum of these output vectors. These weights are interpreted as the degree to which the network attends to a particular token in the document when answering the query:  \nm(t)=tanh(Wymyd(t)+Wumu)s(t)∝exp(wms⊤m(t)),r=yds,\n\\begin{aligned}\nm(t) &=& \\tanh(W_{ym} y_{d} (t) + W_{um} u)  \\\\\ns(t) &\\propto& \\exp(w^\\top_{ms} m(t)),  \\\\\nr &=& y_d s,\n\\end{aligned}\n​m(t)​s(t)​r​​​=​∝​=​​​tanh(W​ym​​y​d​​(t)+W​um​​u)​exp(w​ms​⊤​​m(t)),​y​d​​s,​​\n\n[success]文本向量是各个单词的weighted sum，问题向量和文本向量的计算方式不同。权重的大小与特定的问题有关，因此u是计算r的参数。[?]公式上可以看出u对r有影响，图上没有看出这层关系。  \n\nwhere we are interpreting y d as a matrix with each column being the composite representation y d (t) of document token t. The variable s(t) is the normalised attention at token t. Given this attention score the embedding of the document r is computed as the weighted sum of the token embeddings.\nThe model is completed with the definition of the joint document and query embedding via a non-linear combination:  \ngAR(d,q)=tanh(Wrgr+Wugu).\ng^{AR} (d,q) = \\tanh(W_{rg} r + W_{ug} u).\ng​AR​​(d,q)=tanh(W​rg​​r+W​ug​​u).\nThe Attentive Reader can be viewed as a generalisation of the application of Memory Networks to question answering [3].  \n\n[info] generalisation：概括、归纳  \n\nThat model employs an attention mechanism at the sentence level where each sentence is represented by a bag of embeddings.

Empirical Evaluation1. Empirical Evaluation\nHaving described a number of models in the previous section, we next evaluate these models on our reading comprehension corpora. Our hypothesis is that neural models should in principle be well suited for this task. However, we argued that simple recurrent models such as the LSTM probably have insufficient expressive power for solving tasks that require complex inference. We expect that the attention-based models would therefore outperform the pure LSTM-based approaches.\nConsidering the second dimension of our investigation, the comparison of traditional versus neural approaches to NLP, we do not have a strong prior favouring one approach over the other. While numerous publications in the past few years have demonstrated neural models outperforming classical methods, it remains unclear how much of that is a side-effect of the language modelling capabilities intrinsic to any neural model for NLP.   \n\n[info]publication：出版物side-effect：副作用intrinsic：固有的  \n\nThe entity anonymisation and permutation aspect of the task presented here may end up levelling the playing field in that regard, favouring models capable of dealing with syntax rather than just semantics.  \n\n[info]syntax：语法的semantics：语义的  \n\nWith these considerations in mind, the experimental part of this paper is designed with a three-fold aim.   \n\n[info] three-fold：三重的  \n\nFirst, we want to establish the difficulty of our machine reading task by applying a wide range of models to it. Second, we compare the performance of parse-based methods versus that of neural models. Third, within the group of neural models examined, we want to determine what each component contributes to the end performance; that is, we want to analyse the extent to which an LSTM can solve this task, and to what extent various attention mechanisms impact performance.  \n\n[success] 实验的三个目的（1）评价task的难度（2）比较基于分析的方法和基于NN的方法的性能（3）NN中使用的各种技术分别起到了什么作用  \n\nAll model hyperparameters were tuned on the respective validation sets of the two corpora. 5 Our experimental results are in Table 5, with the Attentive and Impatient Readers performing best across\nboth datasets.\n  \nFrame-semantic benchmark While the one frame-semantic model proposed in this paper is clearly a simplification of what could be achieved with annotations from an NLP pipeline, it does highlight the difficulty of the task when approached from a symbolic NLP perspective.  \n\n[warning]annotations：注释approached from：从。。。靠近[?] 框架语义模型和symbolic NLP是什么关系？  \n\nTwo issues stand out when analysing the results in detail. First, the frame-semantic pipeline has a poor degree of coverage with many relations not being picked up by our PropBank parser as they do not adhere to the default predicate-argument structure. This effect is exacerbated by the type of language used in the highlights that form the basis of our datasets.   \n\n[success]exacerbate：使恶化框架语言分析方法性能不好的原因1：table 4的PropBank只能列举一部关系，很多不满足“predicate-argument”结构的关系无法列举出来。[?] language used in the highlights是什么意思？  \n\nThe second issue is that the frame-semantic approach does not trivially scale to situations where several sentences, and thus frames, are required to answer a query. This was true for the majority of queries in the dataset.  \n\n[success]框架语言分析方法性能不好的原因1：需要结合多个句子来回答问题的情况在这里不适用。  \n\nWord distance benchmark More surprising perhaps is the relatively strong performance of the word distance benchmark, particularly relative to the frame-semantic benchmark, which we had expected to perform better.   \n\n[success]单词距离算法的性能优于框架语义算法。  \n\nHere, again, the nature of the datasets used can explain aspects of this result. Where the frame-semantic model suffered due to the language used in the highlights, the word distance model benefited. Particularly in the case of the Daily Mail dataset, highlights frequently have significant lexical overlap with passages in the accompanying article, which makes it easy for the word distance benchmark.   \n\n[warning]lexical：语汇的accompanying：附随的单词距离算法优于框架语义算法的原因：受益于“the language used in the highlights”[?] 什么是“the language used in the highlights”   \n\nFor instance the query “Tom Hanks is friends with X’s manager, Scooter Brown” has the phrase “... turns out he is good friends with Scooter Brown, manager for Carly Rae Jepson” in the context. The word distance benchmark correctly aligns these two while the frame-semantic approach fails to pickup the friendship or management relations when parsing the query. We expect that on other types of machine reading data where questions rather than Cloze queries are used this particular model would perform significantly worse.  \n\n[warning]用一个例子来说什么“单词距离算法优于框架语义算法的原因”，这个原因没看懂。  \n\nNeural models Within the group of neural models explored here, the results paint a clear picture with the Impatient and the Attentive Readers outperforming all other models. This is consistent with our hypothesis that attention is a key ingredient for machine reading and question answering due to the need to propagate information over long distances.   \n\n[success] 注意力机制很重要  \n\nThe Deep LSTM Reader performs surprisingly well, once again demonstrating that this simple sequential architecture can do a reasonable job of learning to abstract long sequences, even when they are up to two thousand tokens in length. However this model does fail to match the performance of the attention based models, even though these only use single layer LSTMs. 6  \n\n[success] 没有注意力机制的纯LSTM也有很强的能力。  \n\nThe poor results of the Uniform Reader support our hypothesis of the significance of the attention mechanism in the Attentive model’s performance as the only difference between these models is that the attention variables are ignored in the Uniform Reader. The precision@recall statistics in Figure 2 again highlight the strength of the attentive approach.  \n\n[warning] 这一段没看懂？前面似乎没有介绍Uniform Reader?  \n\nWe can visualise the attention mechanism as a heatmap over a context document to gain further insight into the models’ performance.   \n\n[info] heatmap：热图  \n\nThe highlighted words show which tokens in the document were attended to by the model. In addition we must also take into account that the vectors at each token integrate long range contextual information via the bidirectional LSTM encoders.   \n\n[success] contextual：语境的  \n\nFigure 3 depicts heat maps for two queries that were correctly answered by the Attentive Reader. 7 In both cases confidently arriving at the correct answer requires the model to perform both significant lexical generalsiation, e.g. ‘killed’ ! ‘deceased’, and co-reference or anaphora resolution, e.g. ‘ent119 was killed’ ! ‘he was identified.’ However it is also clear that the model is able to integrate these signals with rough heuristic indicators such as the proximity of query words to the candidate answer.  \n\n[info]lexical generalsiation：词汇概括anaphora resolution：回指分辨率  \n\n  \n"},"TMRC/Conclusion.html":{"url":"TMRC/Conclusion.html","title":"5 Conclusion","keywords":"","body":"1.

Introduction1. Introduction\nLanguage Modeling (LM) is a task central to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Language Understanding. Models which can accurately place distributions over sentences not only encode complexities of language such as grammatical structure, but also distill a fair amount of information about the knowledge that a corpora may contain.   \n\n[success]什么是LM：（1）accurately place distributions over sentences（2）encode complexities of language（3）distill a fair amount of information  \n\nIndeed, models that are able to assign a low probability to sentences that are grammatically correct but unlikely may help other tasks in fundamental language understanding like question answering, machine translation, or text summarization.  \n\n[success] 关于LM作用的一个具体的例子  \n\nLMs have played a key role in traditional NLP tasks such as speech recognition (Mikolov et al., 2010; Arisoy et al., 2012), machine translation (Schwenk et al., 2012; Vaswani et al.), or text summarization (Rush et al., 2015; Filippova et al., 2015). Often (although not always), training better language models improves the underlying metrics of the downstream task (such as word error rate for speech recognition, or BLEU score for translation), which makes the task of training better LMs valuable by itself.  \n\n[success]underlying metrics：基本指标LM的作用1：improve其它NLP tasks的基本指标。  \n\nFurther, when trained on vast amounts of data, language models compactly extract knowledge encoded in the training data. For example, when trained on movie subtitles (Serban et al., 2015; Vinyals & Le, 2015), these language models are able to generate basic answers to questions about object colors, facts about people, etc.   \n\n[success]subtitles：字幕LM的作用2：从大量的数据中提炼简洁的信息  \n\nLastly, recently proposed sequence-to-sequence models employ conditional language models (Mikolov & Zweig, 2012) as their key component to solve diverse tasks like machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) or video generation (Srivastava et al., 2015a).  \n\n[success]LM的作用3：seq2seq问题中的条件语言模型   \n\nDeep Learning and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have fueled language modeling research in the past years as it allowed researchers to explore many tasks for which the strong conditional independence assumptions are unrealistic.   \n\n[success]fuel：加剧conditional independence assumptions：条件独立假设LM在不满足“条件独立假设”的场景中的应用。  \n\nDespite the fact that simpler models, such as N-grams, only use a short history of previous words to predict the next word, they are still a key component to high quality, low perplexity LMs.   \n\n[warning][?] N-grams是什么？N-grams模型简单、效果好。  \n\nIndeed, most recent work on large scale LM has shown that RNNs are great in combination with N-grams, as they may have different strengths that complement N-gram models, but worse when considered in isolation (Mikolov et al., 2011; Mikolov, 2012; Chelba et al., 2013; Williams et al., 2015; Ji et al., 2015a; Shazeer et al., 2015).  \n\n[success]complement：补充RNN与N-gram结合的LM效果好  \n\nWe believe that, despite much work being devoted to small data sets like the Penn Tree Bank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993), research on larger tasks is very relevant as overfitting is not the main limitation in current language modeling, but is the main characteristic of the PTB task. Results on larger corpora usually show better what matters as many ideas work well on small data sets but fail to improve on larger data sets. Further, given current hardware trends and vast amounts of text available on the Web, it is much more straightforward to tackle large scale modeling than it used to be. Thus, we hope that our work will help and motivate researchers to work on traditional LM beyond PTB – for this purpose, we will open-source our models and training recipes.  \n\n[success]这一段解释为什么要探索大规模的LM。（1）小规模数据容易过拟合（2）在小规模数据上有效的模型用到大规模数据上却没有提升（3）硬件发展使用在使用大规模数据更容易。[?]本文说的大规模LM是指模型的规模大还是数据的规模大？  \n\nWe focused on a well known, large scale LM benchmark: the One Billion Word Benchmark data set (Chelba et al., 2013). This data set is much larger than PTB (one thousand fold, 800k word vocabulary and 1B words training data) and far more challenging. Similar to Imagenet (Deng et al., 2009), which helped advance computer vision, we believe that releasing and working on large data sets and models with clear benchmarks will help advance Language Modeling.  \n\n[success]使用的大规模数据集：the One Billion Word Benchmark data set特点：（1）数据量更大（2）更有挑战  \n\nThe contributions of our work are as follows:\n• We explored, extended and tried to unify some of the current research on large scale LM.  \n\n[info] unify：使...统一  \n\n• Specifically, we designed a Softmax loss which is based on character level CNNs, is efficient to train, and is as precise as a full Softmax which has orders of magnitude more parameters.  \n\n[success]训练时字符级的CNN时，使用一种新的Softmax损失函数代替原来的full Softmax损失函数，新Softmax损失函数的优点是：（1）训练效率高（2）结果跟full Softmax一样精确（3）参数更少  \n\n• Our study yielded significant improvements to the state-of-the-art on a well known, large scale LM task: from 51.3 down to 30.0 perplexity for single models whilst reducing the number of parameters by a factor of 20.\n• We show that an ensemble of a number of different models can bring down perplexity on this task to 23.7, a large improvement compared to current state-of-art.\n• We share the model and recipes in order to help and motivate further research in this area.\nIn Section 2 we review important concepts and previous work on language modeling. Section 3 presents our contributions to the field of neural language modeling, emphasizing large scale recurrent neural network training. Sections 4 and 5 aim at exhaustively describing our experience and understanding throughout the project, as well as emplacing our work relative to other known approaches.\n\n[info] emplacing：镶嵌\n\n"},"ELLM/Related.html":{"url":"ELLM/Related.html","title":"2 Related Work","keywords":"","body":"1. Related Work1.1. Language Models1.2. Convolutional Embedding Models1.3. Softmax Over Large Vocabularies1. Related Work\nIn this section we describe previous work relevant to the approaches discussed in this paper. A more detailed discussion on language modeling research is provided in (Mikolov, 2012).\n1.1. Language Models\nLanguage Modeling (LM) has been a central task in NLP. The goal of LM is to learn a probability distribution over sequences of symbols pertaining to a language.   \n\n[success]LM的目标：计算一个语言中各种序列的概率分布  \n\nMuch work has been done on both parametric (e.g., log-linear models) and non-parametric approaches (e.g., count-based LMs). Count-based approaches (based on statistics of N-grams) typically add smoothing which account for unseen(yet possible) sequences, and have been quite successful.   \n\n[success]已有的LM算法：（1）参数算法：log-linear模型（2）非参数算法：基于统计的LM，例如N-grams+平滑  \n\nTo this extent, Kneser-Ney smoothed 5-gram models (Kneser & Ney, 1995) are a fairly strong baseline which, for large amounts of training data, have challenged other parametric approaches based on Neural Networks (Bengio et al., 2006).  \n\n[success]本文使用smoothed 5-gram模型作为baseline。这是一种性能非常好的非参数模型。  \n\nMost of our work is based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) models which retain long term dependencies. To this extent, we used the Long-Short Term Memory model (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) which uses a gating mechanism (Gers et al., 2000) to ensure proper propagation of information through many time steps.   \n\n[success]To this extent：在这个程度上本文使用RNN+LSTM以保持长期依赖  \n\nMuch work has been done on small and large scale RNN-based LMs (Mikolov et al., 2010; Mikolov, 2012; Chelba et al., 2013; Zaremba et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2015; Ji et al., 2015a; Wang & Cho, 2015; Ji et al., 2015b). The architectures that we considered in this paper are represented in Figure 1.  \nIn our work, we train models on the popular One Billion Word Benchmark, which can be considered to be a medium-sized data set for count-based LMs but a very large data set for NN-based LMs. This regime is most interesting to us as we believe learning a very good model of human language is a complex task which will require large models, and thus large amounts of data.  \n\n[info] regime：政权\n\nFurther advances in data availability and computational resources helped our study. We argue this leap in scale enabled tremendous advances in deep learning. A clear example found in computer vision is Imagenet (Deng et al., 2009), which enabled learning complex vision models from large amounts of data (Krizhevsky et al., 2012).\nA crucial aspect which we discuss in detail in later sections is the size of our models. Despite the large number of parameters, we try to minimize computation as much as possible by adopting a strategy proposed in (Sak et al., 2014) of projecting a relatively big recurrent state space down so that the matrices involved remain relatively small, yet the model has large memory capacity.\n\n[success]matrices：矩阵\n使用“projecting a relatively big recurrent state space down”的算法可以用较小的矩阵而得到较大的容量。  \n\n1.2. Convolutional Embedding Models\nThere is an increased interest in incorporating character-level inputs to build word embeddings for various NLP problems, including part-of-speech tagging, parsing and language modeling (Ling et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015;  \n\n[info] incorporating：合并  \n\nBallesteros et al., 2015). The additional character information has been shown useful on relatively small benchmark data sets.   \n\n[success]在word embedding中加入字符级表示，在小数据集场景中非常有用。  \n\nThe approach proposed in (Ling et al., 2015) builds word embeddings using bidirectional LSTMs (Schuster & Paliwal, 1997; Graves & Schmidhuber, 2005) over the characters. The recurrent networks process sequences of characters from both sides and their final state vectors are concatenated. The resulting representation is then fed to a Neural Network. This model achieved very good results on a part-of-speech tagging task.  \n\n[success]用双向LSTM生成字符级表示过程：两个RNN分别从字符序列的两端开始读入字符，最后的向量是两个RNN向量的拼接。性能：在“part-of-speech tagging”任务中有好的性能。  \n\nIn (Kim et al., 2015), the words characters are processed by a 1-d CNN (Le Cun et al., 1990) with max-pooling across the sequence for each convolutional feature. The resulting features are fed to a 2-layer highway network (Srivastava et al., 2015b), which allows the embedding to learn semantic representations.   \n\n[success]用卷积生成字符级表示过程：字符序列 -- 1维CNN -- 最大池 --- 2层highway -- embedding   \n\nThe model was evaluated on small scale language modeling experiments for various languages and matched the best results on the PTB data set despite having 60% fewer parameters.  \n\n[warning]性能：（1）在PTB上有好的效果（2）参数减少60%，[?]跟谁比少60%？\n\n1.3. Softmax Over Large Vocabularies\nAssigning probability distributions over large vocabularies is computationally challenging. For modeling language, maximizing log-likelihood of a given word sequence leads to optimizing cross-entropy between the target probability distribution (e.g., the target word we should be predicting), and our model predictions p. Generally, predictions come from a linear layer followed by a Softmax non-linearity:p(w)=exp⁡(zw)∑w′∈Vexp⁡(zw′)p(w) = \\frac{\\exp(z_w)}{\\sum_{w'\\in V}\\exp(z_{w'})}p(w)=∑w′∈V​exp(zw′​)exp(zw​)​where zwz_wzw​ is the logit corresponding to a word w. The logit is generally computed as an inner product zw=h⊤ewz_w = h^\\top e_wzw​=h⊤ew​ where h is a context vector and ewe_wew​ is a “word embedding” for w.  \n\n[success]目标是最大化对数似然估计，即“目标概率分布”和“预测概率分布”的交叉熵在NN中通常使用softmax来计算多分类问题的“预测概率分布”。  \n\nThe main challenge when |V| is very large (in the order of one million in this paper) is the fact that computing all inner products between h and all embeddings becomes prohibitively slow during training (even when exploiting matrix-matrix multiplications and modern GPUs).   \n\n[success]prohibitively slow：太慢了大规模LM的瓶颈在于用softmax计算“预测概率分布”太慢了。  \n\nSeveral approaches have been proposed to cope with the scaling issue: importance sampling (Bengio et al., 2003; Bengio & Senécal, 2008), Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) (Gutmann & Hyvärinen, 2010; Mnih & Kavukcuoglu, 2013), self normalizing partition functions (Vincent et al., 2015) or Hierarchical Softmax (Morin & Bengio, 2005; Mnih & Hinton, 2009) – they all offer good solutions to this problem.   \n\n[success]Contrastive：对比的解决以上问题的已有方法包括：（1）importance sampling（2）Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE)（3）self normalizing partition functions（4）Hierarchical Softmax  \n\nWe found importance sampling to be quite effective on this task, and explain the connection between it and NCE in the following section, as they are closely related.\n\n[success]本文结论：（1）importance sampling在本文中有效（2）importance sampling和NCE有联系  \n\n"},"ELLM/Improvements.html":{"url":"ELLM/Improvements.html","title":"3 Language Modeling Improvements","keywords":"","body":"1.

A Hierarchical Softmax (Mnih & Hinton, 2009) employs a tree in which the probability distribution over words is decomposed into a product of two probabilities for each word, greatly reducing training and inference time as only the path specified by the hierarchy needs to be computed and updated.  \n\n[success]inference：推断这一段讲的是Hierarchical Softmax的原理。Hierarchical Softmax对训练阶段和预测阶段都适用。  \n\nChoosing a good hierarchy is important for obtaining good results and we did not explore this approach further for this paper as sampling methods worked well for our setup.  \n\n[success]本文没有尝试这种方法。  \n\nSampling approaches are only useful during training, as they propose an approximation to the loss which is cheap to compute (also in a distributed setting) – however, at inference time one still has to compute the normalization term over all words.  \n\n[success]Sampling approaches只能用于训练阶段，不能用于预测阶段。这一段所描述的NCE中Sampling approaches的一种。  \n\nNoise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) proposes to consider a surrogate binary classification task in which a classifier is trained to discriminate between true data, or samples coming from some arbitrary distribution.  \n\n[success] surrogate：代理的二分类问题：前i-1个w已知的情况下，wi是来自正样本分布的概率。正样本：在训练数据中，前i-1个w特定的情况下，第i个单词为正样本。负样本：随机选择的单词为负样本。正样本是在训练数据中找到的，所以数量有限。负样本是随机生成的，所以数量无限。  \n\nIf both the noise and data distributions were known, the\noptimal classifier would be:  \np(Y=true∣w)=pd(w)pd(w)+kpn(w)\np(Y = true|w) = \\frac{p_d (w)}{p_d (w) + kp_n (w)}\np(Y=true∣w)=​p​d​​(w)+kp​n​​(w)​​p​d​​(w)​​\nwhere Y is the binary random variable indicating whether w comes from the true data distribution, k is the number of negative samples per positive word, and p_d and p_n are the data and noise distribution respectively (we dropped any dependency on previous words for notational simplicity).  \n\n[success]Y = true：w来自true data的分布Y = false：w来自某个任意分布（noise分布）PdP_dPd​：true data分布PnP_nPn​：noise分布P(Y=true∣w)=P(Y=true,w)P(w)=P(w∣Y=true)P(Y=true)P(w)=P(w∣Y=true)P(Y=true)P(w∣Y=true)P(Y=true)+P(w∣Y=false)P(Y=false)=P(w∣Y=true)P(w∣Y=true)+P(w∣Y=false)P(Y=false)P(Y=true)=Pd(w)Pd(w)+kPn(w)\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(Y=true|w) &=& \\frac{P(Y=true, w)}{P(w)}  \\\\\n&=& \\frac{P(w|Y=true)P(Y=true)}{P(w)}  \\\\\n&=& \\frac{P(w|Y=true)P(Y=true)}{P(w|Y=true)P(Y=true)+P(w|Y=false)P(Y=false)}   \\\\\n&=& \\frac{P(w|Y=true)}{P(w|Y=true) + P(w|Y=false)\\frac{P(Y=false)}{P(Y=true)}}  \\\\\n&=& \\frac{P_d(w)}{P_d(w) + kP_n(w)}\n\\end{aligned}\n​P(Y=true∣w)​​​​​​​=​=​=​=​=​​​​P(w)​​P(Y=true,w)​​​​P(w)​​P(w∣Y=true)P(Y=true)​​​​P(w∣Y=true)P(Y=true)+P(w∣Y=false)P(Y=false)​​P(w∣Y=true)P(Y=true)​​​​P(w∣Y=true)+P(w∣Y=false)​P(Y=true)​​P(Y=false)​​​​P(w∣Y=true)​​​​P​d​​(w)+kP​n​​(w)​​P​d​​(w)​​​​\n\nIt is easy to show that if we train a logistic classifier pθ(Y=true∣w)=σ(sθ(w,h)−log⁡kpn(w))p_\\theta (Y = true|w) = \\sigma(s_\\theta (w,h) - \\log kp_n (w))pθ​(Y=true∣w)=σ(sθ​(w,h)−logkpn​(w)) where σ is the logistic function, then, p′(w)=softmax(sθ(w,h))p'(w) = softmax(s_\\theta (w,h))p′(w)=softmax(sθ​(w,h)) is a good approximation of pd(w)p_d (w)pd​(w) (sθs_\\thetasθ​ is a logit which e.g. an LSTM LM computes).  \n\n[success]logistic functionlogit：逻辑回归把logistic function代入以上公式得：pθ(Y=true∣w)=exp(Sθ(w,h))exp(Sθ(w,h))+kPn(w)\np_\\theta (Y = true|w) = \\frac{\\exp(S_\\theta(w, h))}{\\exp(S_\\theta(w, h)) + kP_n(w)}\np​θ​​(Y=true∣w)=​exp(S​θ​​(w,h))+kP​n​​(w)​​exp(S​θ​​(w,h))​​\n结合前面的公式：Sθ(w,h)=h⊤ewp(w)=Sθ(w,h)∑wSθ(w,h)pθ(Y=true∣w)=Pd(w)Pd(w)+kPn(w)\n\\begin{aligned}\nS_\\theta(w, h) = h^\\top e_w    \\\\\np(w) = \\frac{S_\\theta(w, h)}{\\sum_w S_\\theta(w, h)}    \\\\\np_\\theta (Y = true|w) = \\frac{P_d(w)}{P_d(w) + kP_n(w)}\n\\end{aligned}\n​S​θ​​(w,h)=h​⊤​​e​w​​​p(w)=​∑​w​​S​θ​​(w,h)​​S​θ​​(w,h)​​​p​θ​​(Y=true∣w)=​P​d​​(w)+kP​n​​(w)​​P​d​​(w)​​​​\n[?]看上去p'(w)就是p(w)，为什么说p′(w)p'(w)p′(w)是pd(w)p_d (w)pd​(w)的近似呢？  \n\nThe other technique, which is based on importance sampling (IS), proposes to directly approximate the partition function (which comprises a sum over all words) with an estimate of it through importance sampling.   \n\n[warning]partition function：[?] 配分函数\n\nThough the methods look superficially similar, we will derive a similar surrogate classification task akin to NCE which arrives at IS, showing a strong connection between the two.  \n\n[info]superficially：从表面上看akin to：类似于  \n\nSuppose that, instead of having a binary task to decide if a word comes from the data or from the noise distribution, we want to identify the words coming from the true data distribution in a set W = {w 1 ,...,w k+1 }, comprised of k noise samples and one data distribution sample. Thus, we can train a multiclass loss over a multinomial random variable Y which maximizes logp(Y = 1|W), assuming w.l.o.g. that w 1 ∈ W is always the word coming from true\ndata.   \n\n[info] w.l.o.g：without loss of generality，不失一般性地  \n\nBy Bayes rule, and ignoring terms that are constant with respect to Y , we can write:  \np(Y=k∣W)∝Ypd(wk)pn(wk)\np(Y = k|W) \\propto Y \\frac{p_d (w_k )}{p_n (w_k )}\np(Y=k∣W)∝Y​p​n​​(w​k​​)​​p​d​​(w​k​​)​​\nand, following a similar argument than for NCE, if we define p(Y = k|W) = softmax(s θ (w k )−logp n (w k )) then p 0 (w) = softmax(s θ (w,h)) is a good approximation of p d (word). Note that the only difference between NCE and IS is that, in NCE, we define a binary classification task between true or noise words with a logistic loss, whereas in IS we define a multiclass classification problem with a Softmax and cross entropy loss. We hope that our derivation helps clarify the similarities and differences between the two. In particular, we observe that IS, as it optimizes a multiclass classification task (in contrast to solving a binary task), may be a better choice. Indeed, the updates to the logits with IS are tied whereas in NCE they are independent.  \n\n[warning]最后一句是什么意思？没看懂？  \n\n1.2. CNN Softmax\nThe character-level features allow for a smoother and compact parametrization of the word embeddings.   \n\n[warning]为什么说“字符级表示的特征”更平滑和简洁呢？  \n\nRecent efforts on small scale language modeling have used CNN character embeddings for the input embeddings (Kim et al., 2015). Although not as straightforward, we propose an extension to this idea to also reduce the number of parameters of the Softmax layer.   \n\n[success]由于CNN有使参数简洁的作用，本文把CNN结合到softmax层，目的是减少softmax层的参数数量。  \n\nRecall from Section 2.3 that the Softmax computes a logit as zw=h⊤ewz_w = h^\\top e_wzw​=h⊤ew​ where h is a context vector and ewe_wew​ the word embedding. Instead of building a matrix of |V | × |h| (whose rows correspond to ewe_wew​ ), we produce e w with a CNN over the characters of w as ew=CNN(charsw)e_w = CNN(chars_w )ew​=CNN(charsw​) – we call this a CNN Softmax.   \n\n[success] CNN Softmax的原理：用CNN代替矩阵来生成word embedding ewe_wew​。原来ewe_wew​是LSTM层生成的，现在用CNN层产生，那LSTM层去哪了？[?] charswchars_wcharsw​是什么？  \n\nWe used the same network architecture to dynamically generate the Softmax word embeddings without sharing the parameters with the input word-embedding sub-network. For inference, the vectors ewe_wew​ can be precomputed, so there is no computational complexity increase w.r.t. the regular Softmax.  \n\n[success]CNN Softmax的好处：没有额外的计算。CNN层训练好之后，可以把所有charswchars_wcharsw​对应的ewe_wew​都提前算出来。因此在预测阶段不需要再实时计算了。  \n\nWe note that, when using an importance sampling loss such as the one described in Section 3.1, only a few logits have non-zero gradient (those corresponding to the true and sampled words).  \n\n[success] IS loss的特点：只有一小部分具有非0梯度  \n\nWith a Softmax where ewe_wew​ are independently learned word embeddings, this is not a problem.   \n\n[success] Softmax loss的特点：embedding是独立的。    \n\nBut we observed that, when using a CNN, all the logits become tied as the function mapping from w to e w is quite smooth. As a result, a much smaller learning rate had to be used.  \n\n[success] CNN Softmax的优点：平滑  \n\nEven with this, the model lacks capacity to differentiate between words that have very different meanings but that are spelled similarly.   \n\n[success] CNN Softmax的缺点：不同含义单词的差异不够大  \n\nThus, a reasonable compromise was to add a small correction factor which is learned per word,   \n\n[success]解决方法：增加一个校正因子  \n\nsuch that:  \nzw=h⊤CNN(charsw)+h⊤TMcorrw\nz_w = h^\\top CNN(chars_w ) + h^\\top T Mcorr_w\nz​w​​=h​⊤​​CNN(chars​w​​)+h​⊤​​TMcorr​w​​\nwhere M is a matrix projecting a low-dimensional embedding vector corr w back up to the dimensionality of the projected LSTM hidden state of h. This amounts to adding a bottleneck linear layer, and brings the CNN Softmax much closer to our best result, as can be seen in Table 1, where adding a 128-dim correction halves the gap between regular and the CNN Softmax.  \n\n[warning]halve：减半上面好几段其实没看懂  \n\nAside from a big reduction in the number of parameters and incorporating morphological knowledge from words, the other benefit of this approach is that out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words can easily be scored. This may be useful for other problems such as Machine Translation where handling out-of-vocabulary words is very important (Luong et al., 2014). This approach also allows parallel training over various data sets since the model is no longer explicitly parametrized by the vocabulary size – or the language.  \n\n[success] 字符级表示的优点：（1）参数减少（2）结合构词法知识（3）处理单词表以外的单词（4）平行处理  \n\nThis has shown to help when using byte-level input embeddings for named entity recognition (Gillick et al., 2015), and we hope it will enable similar gains when used to map onto words.\n1.3. Char LSTM Predictions\nThe CNN Softmax layer can handle arbitrary words and is much more efficient in terms of number of parameters than the full Softmax matrix. It is, though, still considerably slow, as to evaluate perplexities we need to compute the partition function.  \n\n[success]perplexities：混乱，一种度量指标，在下一节有讲要解决的问题：评价“perplexities”很费时  \n\nA class of models that solve this problem more efficiently are character-level LSTMs (Sutskever et al., 2011; Graves, 2013). They make predictions one character at a time, thus allowing to compute probabili ties over a much smaller vocabulary.   \n\n[success]已有的解决方案：字符级LSTM  \n\nOn the other hand, these models are more difficult to train and seem to perform worse even in small tasks like PTB (Graves, 2013). Most likely this is due to the sequences becoming much longer on average as the LSTM reads the input character by character instead of word by word.  \n\n[success]字符级LSTM的问题：难以训练  \n\nThus, we combine the word and character-level models by feeding a word-level LSTM hidden state h into a small LSTM that predicts the target word one character at a time (see Figure 1(c)).   \n\nIn order to make the whole process reasonably efficient, we train the standard LSTM model until convergence, freeze its weights, and replace the standard word-level Softmax layer with the aforementioned character-level LSTM.  \n\n[info] aforementioned：前面提到的  \n\nThe resulting model scales independently of vocabulary size – both for training and inference. However, it does seem to be worse than regular and CNN Softmax – we are hopeful that further research will enable these models to replace fixed vocabulary models whilst being computationally attractive.  \n\n[success]优点：模型大小与|V|无关缺点：性能变差  \n\n"},"ELLM/Experiments.html":{"url":"ELLM/Experiments.html","title":"4 Experiments","keywords":"","body":"1. Experiments1.1. Data Set1.2. Model Setup1.3. Model Architecture1.4. Training Procedure1. Experiments\nAll experiments were run using the TensorFlow system (Abadi et al., 2015), with the exception of some older models which were used in the ensemble.  \n1.1. Data Set\nThe experiments are performed on the 1B Word Benchmark data set introduced by (Chelba et al., 2013), which is a publicly available benchmark for measuring progress of statistical language modeling. The data set contains about 0.8B words with a vocabulary of 793471 words, including sentence boundary markers.   \n\n[success] 数据集介绍  \n\nAll the sentences are shuffled and the duplicates are removed. The words that are out of vocabulary (OOV) are marked with a special UNK token (there are approximately 0.3% such words).\n1.2. Model Setup\nThe typical measure used for reporting progress in language modeling is perplexity, which is the average per-word log-probability on the holdout data set:exp⁡(−1N∑iln⁡pwi)\\exp(-\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i\\ln p_{w_i})exp(−N1​∑i​lnpwi​​). We follow the standard procedure and sum over all the words (including the end of sentence symbol).  \n\n[success]衡量指标：perplexity  \n\nWe used the 1B Word Benchmark data set without any preprocessing. Given the shuffled sentences, they are input to the network as a batch of independent streams of words. Whenever a sentence ends, a new one starts without any padding (thus maximizing the occupancy per batch).\nFor the models that consume characters as inputs or as targets, each word is fed to the model as a sequence of character IDs of prespecified length (see Figure 1(b)).   \n\n[info]consume：消费prespecified：预定义的  \n\nThe words were processed to include special begin and end of word tokens and were padded to reach the expected length. I.e. if the maximum word length was 10, the word “cat” would be transformed to “$catˆ ” due to the CNN model.\nIn our experiments we found that limiting the maximum word length in training to 50 was sufficient to reach very good results while 32 was clearly insufficient. We used 256 characters in our vocabulary and the non-ascii symbols were represented as a sequence of bytes.\n1.3. Model Architecture\nWe evaluated many variations of RNN LM architectures. These include the dimensionalities of the embedding layers, the state, projection sizes, and number of LSTM layers to use. Exhaustively trying all combinations would be extremely time consuming for such a large data set, but our findings suggest that LSTMs with a projection layer (i.e., a bottleneck between hidden states as in (Sak et al., 2014)) trained with truncated BPTT (Williams & Peng, 1990) for 20 steps performed well.  \n\n[warning] [?] projection layer  \n\nFollowing (Zaremba et al., 2014) we use dropout (Srivastava, 2013) before and after every LSTM layer. The biases of LSTM forget gate were initialized to 1.0 (Jozefowicz et al., 2015). The size of the models will be described in more detail in the following sections, and the choices of hyper-parameters will be released as open source upon publication.\nFor any model using character embedding CNNs, we closely follow the architecture from (Kim et al., 2015). The only important difference is that we use a larger number of convolutional features of 4096 to give enough capacity to the model. The resulting embedding is then linearly transformed to match the LSTM projection sizes. This allows it to match the performance of regular word embeddings but only uses a small fraction of parameters.\n1.4. Training Procedure\nThe models were trained until convergence with an AdaGrad optimizer using a learning rate of 0.2. In all the experiments the RNNs were unrolled for 20 steps without ever resetting the LSTM states. We used a batch size of 128. We clip the gradients of the LSTM weights such that their norm is bounded by 1.0 (Pascanu et al., 2012).\nUsing these hyper-parameters we found large LSTMs to be relatively easy to train. The same learning rate was used in almost all of the experiments. In a few cases we had to reduce it by an order of magnitude. Unless otherwise stated, the experiments were performed with 32 GPU workers and asynchronous gradient updates. Further details will be fully specified with the code upon publication.\nTraining a model for such large target vocabulary (793471 words) required to be careful with some details about the approximation to full Softmax using importance sampling.\nWe used a large number of negative (or noise) samples: 8192 such samples were drawn per step, but were shared across all the target words in the batch (2560 total, i.e. 128 times 20 unrolled steps). This results in multiplying (2560 x 1024) times (1024 x (8192+1)) (instead of (2560 x 1024)\ntimes (1024 x 793471)), i.e. about 100-fold less computation.\n"},"ELLM/Results.html":{"url":"ELLM/Results.html","title":"5 Results and Analysis","keywords":"","body":"1.

Results and Analysis\nIn this section we summarize the results of our experiments and do an in-depth analysis. Table 1 contains all results for our models compared to previously published work.  \n\n[]info] in-depth：深入地  \n\nTable 2 shows previous and our own work on ensembles of models. We hope that our encouraging results, which improved the best perplexity of a single model from 51.3 to 30.0 (whilst reducing the model size considerably), and set a new record with ensembles at 23.7, will enable rapid research and progress to advance Language Modeling. For this purpose, we will release the model weights and recipes upon publication.\n1.1. Size Matters\nUnsurprisingly, size matters: when training on a very large and complex data set, fitting the training data with an LSTM is fairly challenging. Thus, the size of the LSTM layer is a very important factor that influences the results, as seen in Table 1. The best models are the largest we were able to fit into a GPU memory. Our largest model was a 2-layer LSTM with 8192+1024 dimensional recurrent state in each of the layers. Increasing the embedding and projection size also helps but causes a large increase in the number of parameters, which is less desirable. Lastly, training an RNN instead of an LSTM yields poorer results (about 5 perplexity worse) for a comparable model size.\n1.2. Regularization Importance\nAs shown in Table 1, using dropout improves the results. To our surprise, even relatively small models (e.g., single layer LSTM with 2048 units projected to 512 dimensional outputs) can over-fit the training set if trained long enough, eventually yielding holdout set degradation.  \nUsing dropout on non-recurrent connections largely mitigates these issues.   \n\n[warning]mitigate：减轻、缓和[?] non-recurrent connections  \n\nWhile over-fitting still occurs, there is no more need for early stopping. For models that had 4096 or less units in the LSTM layer, we used 10% dropout probability. For larger models, 25% was significantly better. Even with such regularization, perplexities on the training set can be as much as 6 points below test.\nIn one experiment we tried to use a smaller vocabulary comprising of the 100,000 most frequent words and found the difference between train and test to be smaller – which suggests that too much capacity is given to rare words. This is less of an issue with character CNN embedding models as the embeddings are shared across all words.\n1.3. Importance Sampling is Data Efficient\nTable 3 shows the test perplexities of NCE vs IS loss after a few epochs of 2048 unit LSTM with 512 projection. The IS objective significantly improves the speed and the overall performance of the model when compared to NCE.\n1.4. Word Embeddings vs Character CNN\nReplacing the embedding layer with a parametrized neural network that process characters of a given word allows the model to consume arbitrary words and is not restricted to a fixed vocabulary. This property is useful for data sets with conversational or informal text as well as for morphologically rich languages. Our experiments show that using character-level embeddings is feasible and does not degrade performance – in fact, our best single model uses a Character CNN embedding.\nAn additional advantage is that the number of parameters of the input layer is reduced by a factor of 11 (though training speed is slightly worse). For inference, the embeddings can be precomputed so there is no speed penalty. Overall, the embedding of the best model is parametrized by 72M weights (down from 820M weights).\nTable 4 shows a few examples of nearest neighbor embeddings for some out-of-vocabulary words when character CNNs are used.\n1.5. Smaller Models with CNN Softmax\nEven with character-level embeddings, the model is still fairly large (though much smaller than the best competing models from previous work). Most of the parameters are in the linear layer before the Softmax: 820M versus a total of 1.04B parameters.\nIn one of the experiments we froze the word-LSTM after convergence and replaced the Softmax layer with the CNN Softmax sub-network. Without any fine-tuning that model was able to reach 39.8 perplexity with only 293M weights (as seen in Table 1).\nAs described in Section 3.2, adding a “correction” word embedding term alleviates the gap between regular and CNN Softmax.  \n\n[info] alleviates：缓和  \n\nIndeed, we can trade-off model size versus perplexity. For instance, by adding 100M weights (through a 128 dimensional bottleneck embedding) we achieve 35.8 perplexity (see Table 1).\nTo contrast with the CNN Softmax, we also evaluated a model that replaces the Softmax layer with a smaller LSTM that predicts one character at a time (see Section 3.3). Such a model does not have to learn long dependencies because the base LSTM still operates at the word-level (see Figure 1(c)). With a single-layer LSTM of 1024 units we reached 49.0 test perplexity, far below the best model. In order to make the comparisons more fair, we performed a very expensive marginalization over the words in the vocabulary (to rule out words not in the dictionary which the character LSTM would assign some probability).   \n\n[info] marginalization：边缘化  \n\nWhen doing this marginalization, the perplexity improved a bit down to 47.9.\n1.6. Training Speed\nWe used 32 Tesla K40 GPUs to train our models. The smaller version of the LSTM model with 2048 units and 512 projections needs less than 10 hours to reach below 45 perplexity and after only 2 hours of training the model beats previous state-of-the art on this data set. The best model needs about 5 days to get to 35 perplexity and 10 days to 32.5. The best results were achieved after 3 weeks of training. See Table 3 for more details.\n1.7. Ensembles\nWe averaged several of our best models and we were able to reach 23.7 test perplexity (more details and results can be seen in Table 2), which is more than 40% improvement over previous work. Interestingly, including the best N-gram model reduces the perplexity by 1.2 point even though the model is rather weak on its own (67.6 perplexity). Most previous work had to either ensemble with the best N-gram model (as their RNN only used a limited output vocabulary of a few thousand words), or use N-gram features as additional input to the RNN. Our results, on the contrary, suggest that N-grams are of limited benefit, and suggest that a carefully trained LSTM LM is the most\ncompetitive model.\n1.8. LSTMs are best on the tail words\n\n[warning] [?]tail words：尾词？  \n\nFigure 2 shows the difference in log probabilities between our best model(at30.0perplexity)andtheKN-5. Ascanbe seenfromtheplot, the LSTM is better across all the buckets and significantly outperforms KN-5 on the rare words. This is encouraging as it seems to suggest that LSTM LMs may fare even better for languages or data sets where the number of rare words is larger than traditional N-gram models.   \n\n[info] rare words：稀有词  \n\n1.9. Samples from the model\nTo qualitatively evaluate the model, we sampled many sentences. We discarded short and politically incorrect ones, but the sample shown below is otherwise “raw” (i.e., not hand picked).

Discussion and Conclusions2. Acknowledgements1. Discussion and Conclusions\nIn this paper we have shown that RNN LMs can be trained on large amounts of data, and outperform competing models including carefully tuned N-grams. The reduction in perplexity from 51.3 to 30.0 is due to several key components which we studied in this paper. Thus, a large, regularized LSTM LM, with projection layers and trained with an approximation to the true Softmax with importance sampling performs much better than N-grams. Unlike previous work, we do not require to interpolate both the RNN LM and the N-gram, and the gains of doing so are rather marginal.\nBy exploring recent advances in model architectures (e.g. LSTMs), exploiting small character CNNs, and by sharing our findings in this paper and accompanying code and models (to be released upon publication), we hope to inspire research on large scale Language Modeling, a problem we consider crucial towards language understanding.

Introduction1. Introduction\nNeural   Machine   Translation   (NMT)   achieved state-of-the-art performances in large-scale translation   tasks   such   as   from   English   to   French(Luong et al., 2015)    and    English    to    German(Jean et al., 2015).  NMT is appealing since it requires minimal domain knowledge and is conceptually simple.   The model by Luong et al. (2015)reads through all the source words until the end-of-sentence symbolis reached. It then starts1All  our   code   and  models  are   publicly  available  athttp://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/nmt.BCDXYZXYZAFigure 1:Neural machine translation– a stacking recurrent architecture for translating a sourcesequenceA B C Dinto  a  target  sequenceX YZ.

NMT is often a large neural network thatis trained in an end-to-end fashion and has the ability to generalize well to very long word sequences.This means the model does not have to explicitly store gigantic phrase tables and language modelsas in  the case  of standard  MT; hence,  NMT hasa small memory footprint.    \n\n[info]gigantic：巨大的memory footprint：内存占用  \n\nLastly,  implementingNMT decoders is easy unlike the highly intricate decoders in standard MT (Koehn et al., 2003).\n\n[success]intricate：复杂的NMT的特点：（1）在大规模翻译任务上性能好（2）需要较少的领域知识（3）conceptually simple（4）通常是一个很大的神经网络（5）能够生成长的序列（6）内存占用少（7）decoder实现简单  \n\nIn   parallel,   the   concept   of   “attention”   has gained popularity  recently in training  neural networks,  allowing  models  to  learn  alignments  between  different  modalities,  e.g.,  between  image objects  and  agent  actions  in  the  dynamic  control problem  (Mnih et al., 2014),  between speechframes  and  text  in  the  speech  recognition  task(?),  or  between  visual  features  of  a  picture  andits  text  description  in  the  image  caption  generation  task  (Xu et al., 2015).  \n\n[warning]modalities：形态attention的优势是learn  alignments  between  different  modalities后面是一些具体的应用，怎么alignment的不懂。  \n\nIn  the  context  of NMT, Bahdanau et al. (2015) has successfully applied such attentional mechanism to jointly translate and  align  words.   To the  best  of our knowledge, there has not been any other work exploringthe use of attention-based architectures for NMT.  \n\n[success]注意力机制在NMT中的应用：jointly translate and  align  words  \n\nIn this work, we design, with simplicity and effectiveness in mind, two novel types of attention-based  models:   a global approach  in  which  all source words are attended and alocalone whereby only a subset of source words are considered at a time.  The former approach resembles the modelof (Bahdanau et al., 2015) but is simpler architecturally.  The latter can be viewed as an interesting blend between the hard and soft attention models proposed  in  (Xu et al., 2015):   \n\n[warning] [?] the hard and soft attention models?  \n\nit  is  computationally  less  expensive  than  the  global  model  or  thesoft attention; at the same time, unlike the hard attention, the local attention is differentiable almost every where,  making  it  easier  to  implement  and train.2  \n\n[success]local appproach的特点:（1）比global和soft的计算复杂度低（2）比hard容易实现和训练  \n\nBesides,  we  also  examine  various  alignment functions for our attention-based models.  \n\n[success]alignment function：见3.1  \n\nExperimentally,  we  demonstrate  that  both  of our  approaches  are  effective  in  the  WMT  translation tasks between English and German in bothdirections.   Our attentional  models  yield  a boost of up to 5.0 BLEU over non-attentional  systemswhich already incorporate known techniques suchas  dropout.   For  English  to  German  translation,we  achieve  new  state-of-the-art  (SOTA)  resultsfor  both  WMT’14  and  WMT’15,  outperformingprevious  SOTA  systems,  backed  by  NMT  mod-els  andn-gram  LM rerankers,  by  more than  1.0BLEU. We conduct extensive analysis to evaluateour models in terms of learning, the ability to han-dle long sentences, choices of attentional architec-tures, alignment quality, and translation outputs.\n"},"EAANMT/Neural.html":{"url":"EAANMT/Neural.html","title":"2 Neural Machine Translation","keywords":"","body":"1. Neural Machine Translation1. Neural Machine Translation\nA  neural  machine  translation  system  is  a  neural network that directly models the conditional probability p(y|x) of  translating  a  source  sentence,x1, . . . , xn,  to a target  sentence,y1, . . . , ym.3 A basic form of NMT consists of two components:(a) an encoder which computes a representations for each source sentence and (b) a decoder which generates one target word at a time and hence decomposes the conditional probability as:logp(y∣x)=∑j=1mlogp(yj∣yj,s)(1)\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log p(y|x) =\\sum^m_{j=1}\\log p(y_j|y_{​logp(y∣x)=​j=1​∑​m​​logp(y​j​​∣y​j​​,s)​​​​​​(1)​​\n\n[success]NMT是指计算给定输入序列对应输出序列的概率分布。NMT模型分为encoder和decoder两部分。encoder用于把输入序列的信息打包。decoder用于生成另一个序列。以上公式是decoder的公式。  \n\nA   natural    choice    to   model    such    a   decomposition    in    the    decoder    is    to    use    recurrent neural network(RNN)architecture,   which   most   of   the   recent   NMT   work such as(Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013;Sutskever et al., 2014;Cho et al., 2014;Bahdanau et al., 2015;Luong et al., 2015;Jean et al., 2015)  have  in  common.   They,  however,  differ in terms of which RNN architectures are  used  for  the  decoder  and  how  the  encoder computes the source sentence representation sss.  \n\n[success]encoder：不同的模型对s的编码方式不同。decoder：NMT常用docoder模型是RNN，但在RNN的结构上有所不同   \n\nKalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013)used an RNN   with   the   standard   hidden   unit   for   the decoder  and  a  convolutional  neural  network  for encoding the source sentence representation.   \n\n[success] encoder: CNN, decoder: RNN(standard unit)  \n\nOn the  other  hand,  both  Sutskever et al.

In    (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013;Sutskever et al., 2014;Cho et al., 2014;Luong et al., 2015),the source representations is   only   used   once   to   initialize   the decoder  hidden  state.

In this  model  type,a variable-length alignment vector at, whose size equals the number of time steps on the source side, is derived by comparing the current target hidden state ht with each source hidden state ̄hˉs\\bar h_shˉs​:  \nat(s)=align(ht,h¯s)(7)=exp(score(ht,h¯s))∑s′exp(score(ht,h¯s))\n\\begin{aligned}\na_t(s) &=& align(h_t, \\bar h_s)  &&  (7) \\\\\n&=& \\frac{\\exp(score(ht, \\bar h_s))}{\\sum_{s'}\\exp(score(h_t, \\bar h_s))}\n\\end{aligned}\n​a​t​​(s)​​​​=​=​​​align(h​t​​,​h​¯​​​s​​)​​∑​s​′​​​​exp(score(h​t​​,​h​¯​​​s​​))​​exp(score(ht,​h​¯​​​s​​))​​​​​​​​(7)​​\n   \nHere,score is referred as acontent-based function for which we consider three different alternatives:  \nscore(ht,h¯s)={ht⊤h¯sdotht⊤Wah¯sgeneralva⊤tanh(Wa[ht;h¯s])concat\nscore(h_t, \\bar h_s)=\n\\begin{cases}\nh^\\top_t \\bar h_s  &&  dot   \\\\\nh^\\top_t W_a \\bar h_s  &&  general   \\\\\nv^\\top_a \\tanh(W_a[h_t; \\bar h_s])  &&  concat\n\\end{cases}\nscore(h​t​​,​h​¯​​​s​​)=​⎩​⎪​⎨​⎪​⎧​​​h​t​⊤​​​h​¯​​​s​​​h​t​⊤​​W​a​​​h​¯​​​s​​​v​a​⊤​​tanh(W​a​​[h​t​​;​h​¯​​​s​​])​​​​​​​​dot​general​concat​​\n\n[success] hth_tht​与hˉs\\bar h_shˉs​越相似，分数越高  \n\nBesides, in our early attempts to build attention-based  models,  we  use  alocation-based function in which the alignment scores are computed from solely the target hidden state ht as follows:  \nat=softmax(Waht)location(8)\nat= softmax(Waht)location(8)\nat=softmax(Waht)location(8)\nGiven the alignment vector as weights, the context vector ct is computed as the weighted average overall the source hidden states.6\n\n[success] ctc_tct​是所有hth_tht​的加权平均，权即是ata_tat​   \n\nComparison to (Bahdanau et al., 2015)– While our  global  attention  approach  is  similar  in  spirit to the model proposed by Bahdanau et al. (2015),there are several key differences which reflect how we  have  both  simplified  and  generalized  from the  original  model. First,  we  simply  use  hidden  states  at  the  top  LSTM  layers  in  both  theencoder  and  decoder  as  illustrated  in  Figure  2.Bahdanau et al. (2015),  on  the  other  hand,   use the  concatenation  of  the  forward  and  backward source hidden states in the bi-directional encoder and target hidden states in their non-stacking uni-directional decoder.   \n\n[success]本文与Bahdanau的区别一：本文：使用S-LSTM得到的h_tBahdanau：使用双向LSTM的拼接  \n\nSecond, our computation path is  simpler;  we  go  from ht→at→ct→h~th_t \\rightarrow a_t \\rightarrow c_t \\rightarrow \\tilde h_tht​→at​→ct​→h~t​ then  make  a  prediction  as  detailed  in  Eq.  (5),Eq.  (6),  and  Figure  2. On  the  other  hand,  at any timet, Bahdanau et al. (2015) build from the previous  hidden  state ht−1→at→ct→hth_{t-1} \\rightarrow a_t \\rightarrow c_t \\rightarrow h_tht−1​→at​→ct​→ht​,  which,  in  turn,  goes  through  a  deep-output and  a  maxout  layer  before  making  predictions.7  \n\n[success] 本文与Bahdanau的区别二，不是太懂   \n\nLastly, Bahdanau et al. (2015) only experimented with one alignment function,  the concat product; whereas we show later that the other alternatives are better.  \n\n[success] 本文与Bahdanau的区别三，alignmnet的尝试  \n\n1.2. Local Attention\nThe global attention has a drawback that it has toattend to all words on the source side for each target word, which is expensive and can potentially render it impractical to translate longer sequences,e.g.,  paragraphs  or  documents.   \n\n[success] global的缺点：计算量大  \n\nTo  address  this deficiency,  we propose  a local attentional  mechanism that chooses to focus only on a small subset of the source positions per target word.  \n\n[info] To  address  this：针对这个  \n\nThis model takes inspiration  from the tradeoff between the soft and hard attentional models proposed by Xu et al. (2015) to tackle the image caption generation task.   \n\n[info] caption：标题  \n\nIn their work, soft attention refers  to  the  global  attention  approach  in  whichweights are placed “softly” over all patches in the source  image.    \n\n[success]soft的特点：类似global，所有patch都参与预测，每个patch的weight都是soft的  \n\nThe  hard  attention,  on  the  other hand, selects one patch of the image to attend to at a time. While less expensive at inference time, the hard attention model is non-differentiable and requires more complicated techniques such as variance reduction or reinforcement learning to train.  \n\n[success]non-differentiable：不可微分的variance reduction：方差缩减hard的特点：每次一个patch参与预测，需要其它技术手段辅助。   \n\nOur  local  attention  mechanism  selectively  focuses on a small window of context and is differentiable.   \n\n[info]selectively：有选择地differentiable：可微分地  \n\nThis approach has an advantage of avoiding the expensive computation incurred in the soft attention  and  at  the  same  time,  is  easier  to  trainthan the hard attention approach.    \n\n[success]优点：（1）不像soft那样需要辅助技术（2）没有hard那么大的计算量  \n\nIn concrete details, the model first generates an aligned position pt for each target word at time t.   \n\n[info]\nIn concrete details：具体而言   \n\nThe context vector ct is then derived as a weighted average overthe set of source hidden states within the window[pt-D, pt+D];D is empirically selected.8\n\n[success]（1）生成aligned position pt（2）基于[pt-D, pt+D]生成ct  \n\nUnlike the global approach, the local alignment vectorat is now fixed-dimensional, i.e.,∈R2D+1\\in R_{2D+1}∈R2D+1​. We consider two variants of the model as below.\n  \nMonotonic alignment (local-m) – we simply set pt=t assuming that source and target sequences are roughly monotonically aligned.   \n\n[info] monotonically：单调地  \n\nThe alignment vector at is defined according to Eq. (7).9\nPredictive alignment (local-p) – instead of assuming monotonic alignments, our model predicts an aligned position as follows:pt=S⋅sigmoid(vp⊤tanh(Wpht)),(9)\np_t=S \\cdot sigmoid(v^\\top_p \\tanh(W_ph_t)),(9)\np​t​​=S⋅sigmoid(v​p​⊤​​tanh(W​p​​h​t​​)),(9)\nWpW_pWp​ and vpv_pvp​ are the model parameters which will be learned to predict positions.S is the source sentence length.  As a result of sigmoid, pt∈[0, S].To  favor  alignment  points  near pt,  we  place  a Gaussian distribution centered around pt. Specifically, our alignment weights are now defined as:at(s)=align(ht,h¯s)exp(−(s−pt)22σ2)(10)\na_t(s) = align(h_t, \\bar h_s) \\exp(-\\frac{(s-pt)^2}{2\\sigma^2})(10)\na​t​​(s)=align(h​t​​,​h​¯​​​s​​)exp(−​2σ​2​​​​(s−pt)​2​​​​)(10)\nWe use the same align function as in Eq. (7) and the standard deviation is empirically set as σ=D2\\sigma=\\frac{D}{2}σ=2D​.  \n\n[info] standard deviation：标准差  \n\nNote that pt is a real nummber;  whereas s is an integer within the window centered at pt.10\nComparison to (Gregor et al., 2015)– have proposed a selective attention mechanism, very similar to our local attention, for the image generation task.   \n\n[info] selective attention：选择性注意  \n\nTheir approach allows the model to select an image patch  of varying  location  and zoom.   We, instead,  use the same “zoom” for all target positions, which greatly simplifies the formulation and still achieves good performance.\n1.3. Input-feeding Approach\nIn  our  proposed  global  and  local  approaches,the attentional decisions are made independently,which  is suboptimal.   \n\n[success]suboptimal：次优的每一次把注意力放在哪里都是独立的。  \n\nWhereas,  in  standard  MT,a coverage set  is  often  maintained  during  the translation process to keep track of which source words  have  been  translated.    \n\n[info]coverage set：覆盖集keep track of：记录  \n\nLikewise,  in  attentional NMTs, alignment decisions should be made jointly  taking  into  account  past  alignment  information.    \n\n[info] 同样地  \n\nTo  address  that,  we  propose  an input-feeding approach  in which attentional  vectors h~t\\tilde h_th~t​ are concatenated with inputs at the next time steps as  illustrated  in  Figure  4.11\n\n[success]这一次的注意力位置应该与之前的注意力位置有关联。t-1时刻的注意力向量也作为t时间的输入。  \n\n  \nThe  effects  of  having  such  connections  are  two-fold:  (a)  we  hope to make the model fully aware of previous alignment choices  and (b) we create a very deep network spanning both horizontally and vertically.  \n\n[success]a是目的，b算是副作用吧？  \n\nComparison to other work–Bahdanau et al. (2015) use context vectors,similar  to  our ct,  in  building  subsequent  hidden states,   which  can  also  achieve  the  “coverage” effect.  However, there has not been any analysis of  whether  such  connections  are  useful  as  done in this work.  Also, our approach is more general;as  illustrated  in  Figure  4,  it  can  be  applied  to general stacking recurrent architectures, including non-attentional models.  \n\n[warning][?] 为什么要特意提到S-RNN？[?] 针对attention的改进，对non-attention有什么用？  \n\nXu et al. (2015)  propose  a doubly  attentional approach  with  an  additional  constraint  added  to the training objective to make sure the model pays equal attention to all parts of the image during the caption generation process.  Such a constraint can also  be  useful  to  capture  the  coverage  set  effect in NMT that we mentioned earlier.  However, we chose  to  use  the  input-feeding  approach  since  it provides flexibility for the model to decide on any attentional constraints it deems suitable.  \n\n[success]deem：认为additional  constraint和input-feeding的目的都是coverage set。后者比前者更灵活。  \n\n"},"EAANMT/Experiments.html":{"url":"EAANMT/Experiments.html","title":"4 Experiments","keywords":"","body":"1.

Training Details\nAll our models are trained on the WMT’14 training data consisting of 4.5M sentences pairs (116MEnglish  words,  110M  German  words).    Similarto (Jean et al., 2015), we limit our vocabularies tobe the top 50K most frequent words for both lan-guages.

English-German Results\nWe  compare  our  NMT  systems  in  the  English-German  task  with  various  other  systems.   These include the winning syste minWMT’14(Buck et al., 2014),aphrase-basedsystemwhose  language  models  were  trained  on  a  hugemonolingual  text,   the  Common  Crawl  corpus.For  end-to-end  NMT  systems,   to  the  best  ofour   knowledge,   (Jean et al., 2015)   is   the   onlywork  experimenting  with  this  language  pair  andcurrently  the  SOTA  system.We  only  presentresults for some of our attention models and willlater analyze the rest in Section 5.\nAs   shown   in   Table   1,    we   achieve   pro-gressive  improvements  when  (a)  reversing  thesource  sentence,   +1.3BLEU,  as  proposed   in(Sutskever et al., 2014)   and   (b)   using   dropout,+1.4BLEU.

Thelocal  attention  model  with  predictive  alignments(rowlocal-p)  proves  to  be  even  better,  givingus  a  further  improvement  of  +0.9BLEU on  topof  the  global  attention  model.  \n\n[success] 以上是对性能有提升作用的操作  \n\nIt  is  interesting  to  observe  the  trend  previously  reported  in(Luong et al., 2015) that perplexity strongly correlates with translation quality.  In total, we achievea  significant  gain  of  5.0  BLEU  points  over  thenon-attentional  baseline,  which  already  includesknown  techniques  such  as  source  reversing  and dropout.\nThe unknown replacement technique proposed in (Luong et al., 2015; Jean et al., 2015) yields another nice gain of +1.9BLEU, demonstrating that our attentional models do learn useful alignments for  unknown  works.   \n\n[warning] unknown replacement technique?  \n\nFinally,  by  ensembling  8different  models  of  various  settings,  e.g.,  usingdifferent  attention  approaches,  with  and  withoutdropout etc., we were able to achieve anew SOTAresult of23.0BLEU, outperforming  the existing\nbest system (Jean et al., 2015) by +1.4BLEU.SystemBLEUTop –NMT + 5-gram rerank(Montreal)24.9Our ensemble 8 models + unk replace25.9Table  2:WMT’15  English-German  results–NISTBLEU   scores   of   the   winning   entry   inWMT’15 and our best one on newstest2015.\nLatest results in WMT’15– despite the fact thatour models were trained on WMT’14 with slightlyless data, we test them on newstest2015 to demon-strate that they can generalize well to different testsets.

While  our  systems  have  not  yet  matchedthe performance  of the SOTA system,  we nevertheless  show  the effectiveness  of our approacheswith large and progressive gains in terms of BLEUas  illustrated  in  Table  3.   Theattentionalmech-anism  gives  us  +2.2BLEU  gain  and  on  top  ofthat, we obtain another boost of up to +1.0BLEUfrom  theinput-feedingapproach.

Effects of Translating Long Sentences\nWe  follow  (Bahdanau et al., 2015)  to  group  sen-tences  of  similar  lengths  together  and  computea  BLEU  score  per  group.    Figure  6  shows  thatour attentional models are more effective than thenon-attentional  one  in  handling  long  sentences:the quality does not degrade as sentences becomelonger.  Our best model (the blue + curve) outperforms all other systems in all length buckets.\n1.3. Choices of Attentional Architectures\nWe  examine  different  attention  models  (global,local-m,  local-p)  and  different  alignment  functions (location, dot, general, concat) as describedin Section  3.   Due to  limited  resources,  we can-not run all the possible  combinations.   However,results in Table 4 do give us some idea about dif-ferent choices.  Thelocation-basedfunction does not learn  good alignments:  theglobal  (location)model  can  only  obtain  a  small  gain  when  per-forming unknown word replacement compared tousing  other  alignment  functions.14Forcontent-basedfunctions, our implementationconcatdoesnot  yield  good  performances  and  more  analysisshould  be done to understand  the reason.15It isinteresting to observe thatdotworks well for theglobal attention andgeneralis better for the localattention.  Among the different models,  the localattention model with predictive alignments (local-p) is best, both in terms of perplexities and BLEU.\n1.4. Alignment Quality\nA by-product of attentional models are word alignments.   \n\n[info] by-product：副产品  \n\nWhile  (Bahdanau et al., 2015)  visualized14There  is  a  subtle  difference  in  how  we  retrieve  align-ments for the different alignment functions. At time steptinwhich we receiveyt−1as input and then computeht,at,ct,and ̃htbefore predictingyt, the alignment vectoratis usedas  alignment  weights  for  (a)  the  predicted  wordytin  thelocation-basedalignment  functions  and  (b)  the  input  wordyt−1in thecontent-basedfunctions.15Withconcat, the perplexities achieved by different mod-els are 6.7  (global),  7.1 (local-m),  and  7.1  (local-p).   Suchhigh perplexities could be due to the fact that we simplify thematrixWato set the part that corresponds to ̄hsto identity.MethodAERglobal (location)0.39local-m (general)0.34local-p (general)0.36ensemble0.34Berkeley Aligner0.32Table 6:AER scores– results of various modelson the RWTH English-German alignment data.alignments  for  some  sample  sentences  and  ob-served  gains  in  translation  quality  as  an  indica-tion of a working attention model, no work has as-sessed the alignments learned as a whole.  In con-trast, we set out to evaluate the alignment qualityusing the alignment error rate (AER) metric.\nGiven  the  gold  alignment  data  provided  byRWTH  for  508  English-German  Europarl  sen-tences, we “force” decode our attentional modelsto produce translations that match the references.We extract only one-to-one alignments by select-ing  the  source  word  with  the  highest  alignmentweight per target word. Nevertheless, as shown inTable 6, we were able to achieve AER scores com-parable  to  the  one-to-many  alignments  obtainedby the Berkeley aligner (Liang et al., 2006).16\nWe also found that the alignments produced bylocal  attention  models  achieve  lower  AERs thanthose of the global one. The AER obtained by theensemble, while good, is not better than the local-m  AER,  suggesting  the  well-known  observationthat AER and translation scores are not well cor-related (Fraser and Marcu, 2007).  We show some alignment visualizations in Appendix A.\n1.5.

Alignment Visualization\nWe visualize  the alignment weights produced  byour different attention models in Figure 7. The vi-sualization  of  the  local  attention  model  is  muchsharper than that of the global one.  This contrastmatches our expectation that local attention is de-signed  to  only  focus  on  a  subset  of  words  eachtime. Also, since we translate from English to Ger-man and reverse the source English sentence, thewhite strides at the words“reality”and“.”in theglobal  attention  model  reveals  an  interesting  ac-cess pattern: it tends to refer back to the beginningof the source sequence.Compared  to  the  alignment  visualizations  in(Bahdanau et al., 2015),   our  alignment   patternsare not as sharp as theirs.  Such difference  couldpossibly  be  due  to  the  fact  that  translating  fromEnglish to German is harder than translating intoFrench as done in (Bahdanau et al., 2015), whichis an interesting point to examine in future work.\nTheydonotunderstandwhyEuropeexistsintheorybutnotinreality.Sieverstehennicht,warumEuropatheoretischzwarexistiert,abernichtinWirklichkeit.TheydonotunderstandwhyEuro\n"},"CRFRNN/1.html":{"url":"CRFRNN/1.html","title":"Conditional random fields as recurrent neural networks","keywords":"","body":"Conditional random fields as recurrent neural networks\nlink:http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Zheng_Conditional_Random_Fields_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf  \n这篇论文被分类到了NLP，可能是因为标题上有RNN。但其实它是CV。  \n"},"CRFRNN/Abstract.html":{"url":"CRFRNN/Abstract.html","title":"Abstract","keywords":"","body":"1.

Introduction\nLow-level computer vision problems such as semantic image segmentation or depth estimation often involve assigning a label to each pixel in an image.   \n\n[success]\n像素级标签任务要解决的问题：assigning a label to each pixel in an image\n\nWhile the feature representation used to classify individual pixels plays an important role in this task, it is similarly important to consider factors such as image edges, appearance consistency and spatial consistency while assigning labels in order to obtain accurate and precise results.\n\n[success]feature representation的作用：（1）像素级标签任务（2）image edges, appearance consistency and spatial consistency  \n\nDesigning a strong feature representation is a key challenge in pixel-level labelling problems. Work on this topic includes: TextonBoost [50], TextonForest [49], and Random Forest-based classifiers [48]. Recently, supervised deep learning approaches such as large-scale deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been immensely successful in many high-level computer vision tasks such as image recognition [29] and object detection [19].   \n\n[info] immensely：极其地  \n\nThis motivates exploring the use of CNNs for pixel-level labelling problems. The key insight is to learn a strong feature representation end-to-end for the pixel-level labelling task instead of hand-crafting features with heuristic parameter tuning.   \n\n[info] insight：洞察力  \n\nIn fact, a number of recent approaches including the particularly interesting works FCN [35] and DeepLab [9] have shown a significant accuracy boost by adapting state-of-the-art CNN based image classifiers to the semantic segmentation problem.\nHowever, there are significant challenges in adapting CNNs designed for high level computer vision tasks such as object recognition to pixel-level labelling tasks.   \n\n[success] CNN是为high-level设计的算法，用于low-level的task不是很合适。  \n\nFirstly, traditional CNNs have convolutional filters with large receptive fields and hence produce coarse outputs when restructured to produce pixel-level labels [35]. Presence of maxpooling layers in CNNs further reduces the chance of getting a fine segmentation output [9]. This, for instance, can result in non-sharp boundaries and blob-like shapes in semantic segmentation tasks.   \n\n[success][?] receptive fields[?] blob-like shapesCNN的缺点1：receptive fields和maxpooling会导致边界模糊  \n\nSecondly, CNNs lack smoothness constraints that encourage label agreement between similar pixels, and spatial and appearance consistency of the\nlabelling output. Lack of such smoothness constraints can result in poor object delineation and small spurious regions in the segmentation output [57, 56, 30, 37].  \n\n[success]spurious：假的CNN的缺点1：缺少“smoothness constraints”会导致边界不连续。  \n\nOn a separate track to the progress of deep learning techniques, probabilistic graphical models have been developed as effective methods to enhance the accuracy of pixellevel labelling tasks.   \n\n[success] probabilistic graphical models：概率图模型  \n\nIn particular, Markov Random Fields (MRFs) and its variant Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) have observed widespread success in this area [30, 27] and have become one of the most successful graphical models used in computer vision. The key idea of CRF inference for semantic labelling is to formulate the label assignment problem as a probabilistic inference problem that incorporates assumptions such as the label agreement between similar pixels.   \n\n[success] CRF可以弥补CNN的不足  \n\nCRF inference is able to refine weak and coarse pixel-level label predictions to produce sharp boundaries and fine-grained segmentations. Therefore, intuitively, CRFs can be used to overcome the drawbacks in utilizing CNNs for pixel-level labelling tasks.\nOne way to utilize CRFs to improve the semantic labelling results produced by a CNN is to apply CRF inference as a post-processing step disconnected from the training of the CNN [9]. Arguably, this does not fully harness the strength of CRFs since it is not integrated with the deep network – the deep network cannot adapt its weights to the CRF behaviour during the training phase.  \n\n[success]用CRF来弥补CNN的不足，方法一：把CRF作为与CNN无关的post-processing缺点：没有充分利用CRF的能力  \n\nIn this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning solution for the pixel-level semantic image segmentation problem. Our formulation combines the strengths of both CNNs and CRF based graphical models in one unified framework. More specifically, we formulate mean-field inference of dense CRF with Gaussian pairwise potentials as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which can refine coarse outputs from a traditional CNN in the forward pass, while passing error differentials back to the CNN during training. Importantly, with our formulation, the whole deep network, which comprises a traditional CNN and an RNN for CRF inference, can be trained end-to-end utilizing the usual back-propagation algorithm.\n\n[success]本文的方法：用RNN代表CRF中的Gaussian pairwise potentials优点：（1）refine coarse outputs from a traditional CNN in the forward pass（2）passing error differentials back to the CNN这就是所谓的“end-to-end”  \n\nArguably, when properly trained, the proposed network should outperform a system where CRF inference is applied as a post-processing method on independent pixel-level predictions produced by a pre-trained CNN.   \n\n[success] Arguably：可认证地  \n\nOur experimental evaluation confirms that this indeed is the case.\n"},"CRFRNN/Related.html":{"url":"CRFRNN/Related.html","title":"2. Related Work","keywords":"","body":"1. Related Work1. Related Work\nIn this section we review approaches that make use of deep learning and CNNs for low-level computer vision tasks, with a focus on semantic image segmentation. A wide variety of approaches have been proposed to tackle the semantic image segmentation task using deep learning. These approaches can be categorized into two main strategies.  \nThe first strategy is based on utilizing separate mechanisms for feature extraction, and image segmentation exploiting the edges of the image [2, 36]. One representative instance of this scheme is the application of a CNN for the extraction of meaningful features, and using superpixels to account for the structural pattern of the image.   \n\n[success]用CNN做low-level的计算机视觉任务的策略一：\n（1）用CNN提取特征（2）用superpixels计算structural pattern[?] superpixels  \n\nTwo representative examples are [18, 36], where the authors first obtained superpixels from the image and then used a feature extraction process on each of them. The main disadvantage of this strategy is that errors in the initial proposals (e.g: super-pixels) may lead to poor predictions, no matter how good the feature extraction process is.   \n\n[success]缺点：第（1）（2）两步分开做，（1）做得再好，如果（2）没做好，结果也不会好。  \n\nPinheiro and Collobert [44] employed an RNN to model the spatial dependencies during scene parsing. In contrast to their approach, we show that a typical graphical model such as a CRF can be formulated as an RNN to form a part of a deep network, to perform end-to-end training combined with a CNN.  \n\n[success]解决方法：用RNN实现CRF  \n\nThe second strategy is to directly learn a nonlinear model from the images to the label map. This, for example, was shown in [16], where the authors replaced the last fully connected layers of a CNN by convolutional layers to keep spatial information.   \n\n[success]用CNN做low-level的计算机视觉任务的策略二：directly learn a nonlinear model具体方法一：CNN的最后一层用卷积层代替FC，即全部都是卷积层    \n\nAn important contribution in this direction is [35], where Long et al. used the concept of fully convolutional networks, and the notion that top layers obtain meaningful features for object recognition whereas low layers keep information about the structure of the image, such as edges. In their work, connections from early layers to later layers were used to combine these cues.  \n\n[success]全卷积层的意义：上层提取对象识别的特征，下层提取图像结构的特征。  \n\nBell et al. [5] and Chen et al. [9, 39] used a CRF to refine segmentation results obtained from a CNN. Bell et al. focused on material recognition and segmentation, whereas Chen et al. reported very significant improvements on semantic image segmentation.   \n\n[success]具体方法二：CNN之后再使用CRF做refine这种方法比较好。  \n\nIn contrast to these works, which employed CRF inference as a standalone post-processing step disconnected from the CNN training, our approach is an end-to-end trainable network that jointly learns the parameters of the CNN\nand the CRF in one unified deep network.  \n\n[success]具体方法三（本文方法）：把CNN和CRF结合到同一个网络中  \n\nWorks that use neural networks to predict structured output are found in different domains.   \n\n[success] 用NN预测结构化输出    \n\nFor example, Do et al. [13] proposed an approach to combine deep neural networks and Markov networks for sequence labeling tasks. Another domain which benefits from the combination of CNNs and structured loss is handwriting recognition. In[6], the authors combined a CNN with Hidden Markov Models for that purpose, whereas more recently, Peng et al. [43] used a modified version of CRFs. Related to this line of works, in [24] a joint CNN and CRF model was used for text recognition on natural images. Tompson et al. [55] showed the use of joint training of a CNN and an MRF for human pose estimation, while Chen et al. [10] focused on the image classification problem with a similar approach. Another prominent work is [20], in which the authors express Deformable Part Models, a kind of MRF, as a layer in a neural network. In our approach we cast a different graphical model as a neural network layer.\nA number of approaches have been proposed for automatic learning of graphical model parameters and joint training of classifiers and graphical models. Barbu et al. [4] proposed a joint training of a MRF/CRF model together with an inference algorithm in their Active Random Field approach. Domke [14] advocated back-propagation based parameter optimization in graphical models when approximate inference methods such as mean-field and belief propagation are used. This idea was utilized in [26], where a binary dense CRF was used for human pose estimation. Similarly, Ross et al. [45] and Stoyanov et al. [52] showed how back-propagation through belief propagation can be used to optimize model parameters. Ross et al. [45], in particular, proposed an approach based on learning messages. Many of these ideas can be traced back to [53], which proposed unrolling message passing algorithms as simpler operations that could be performed within a CNN. In a different setup, Krähenbühl and Koltun [28] demonstrated automatic pa-\nrameter tuning of dense CRF when a modified mean-field algorithm is used for inference. An alternative inference approach for dense CRF, not based on mean-field, is proposed in [58].\nIn contrast to the works described above, our approach shows that it is possible to formulate dense CRF as an RNN so that one can form an end-to-end trainable system for semantic image segmentation which combines the strengths of deep learning and graphical modelling. The concurrent and independent work [47] explores a similar joint training approach for semantic segmentation.\n\n[warning] [?] dense CRF  \n\n"},"CRFRNN/CRF.html":{"url":"CRFRNN/CRF.html","title":"3.

A Mean-field Iteration as a Stack of CNN Layers\nA key contribution of this paper is to show that the mean-field CRF inference can be reformulated as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).   \n\n[success] 这一节的目标：用RNN实现mean-field CRF inference  \n\nTo this end, we first consider individual steps of the mean-field algorithm summarized in Algorithm 1 [27], and describe them as CNN layers.   \n\n[success] 第一步：用CNN层描述mean-field CRF算法    \n\nOur contribution is based on the observation that filter-based approximate mean-field inference approach for dense CRFs relies on applying Gaussian spatial and bilateral filters on the mean-field approximates in each iteration.   \n\n[info] bilateral：双边的  \n\nUnlike the standard convolutional layer in a CNN, in which filters are fixed after the training stage, we use edge-preserving Gaussian filters [54, 40], coefficients of which depend on the original spatial and appearance information of the image.   \n\n[info] edge-preserving：保边去噪  \n\nThese filters have the additional advantages of requiring a smaller set of parameters, despite the filter size being potentially as big as the image.  \n\n[success]这里的CNN与标准CNN的区别：CNN：coefficients依赖于图像的original spatial and appearance information标准CNN：训练完成后filters are fixedCNN的优点：需要较少的参数集  \n\nWhile reformulating the steps of the inference algorithm as CNN layers, it is essential to be able to calculate error differentials in each layer w.r.t. its inputs in order to be able to back-propagate the error differentials to previous layers during training.   \n\n[success]w.r.t：关于，with respect/regard/reference to用CNN层描述mean-field CRF算法的关键是计算每一个的错误偏导  \n\nWe also discuss how to calculate error differentials w.r.t. the parameters in each layer, enabling their optimization through the back-propagation algorithm. Therefore, in our formulation, CRF parameters such as the weights of the Gaussian kernels and the label compatibility function can also be optimized automatically during the training of the full network.  \nOnce the individual steps of the algorithm are broken down as CNN layers, the full algorithm can then be formulated as an RNN.   \n\n[success] 第二步：把CNN reformulate 成RNN  \n\nWe explain this in Section 5 after discussing the steps of Algorithm 1 in detail below. In Algorithm 1 and the remainder of this paper, we use Ui(l)U_i(l)Ui​(l) to denote the negative of the unary energy introduced in the previous section, i.e., Ui(l)=−ψu(Xi=l)U_i(l) = -\\psi_u(X_i = l)Ui​(l)=−ψu​(Xi​=l). In the conventional CRF setting, this input Ui(l)U_i(l)Ui​(l) to the mean-field algorithm is obtained from an independent classifier.  \n1.1. Initialization\nIn the initialization step of the algorithm, the operation Qi(l)←1Ziexp⁡(Ui(l))Q_i(l) \\leftarrow \\frac{1}{Z_i}\\exp(U_i(l))Qi​(l)←Zi​1​exp(Ui​(l)), where Zi=∑lexp⁡(Ui(l))Z_i = \\sum_l \\exp(U_i(l))Zi​=∑l​exp(Ui​(l)), is performed. Note that this is equivalent to applying a softmax function over the unary potentials U across all the labels at each pixel. The softmax function has been extensively used in CNN architectures before and is therefore well known in the deep learning community. This operation does not include any parameters and the error differentials received at the output of the step during back-propagation could be passed down to the unary potential inputs after performing usual backward pass calculations of the softmax\ntransformation.  \n\n[success]Qi(l)Q_i(l)Qi​(l)是对Ui(l)U_i(l)Ui​(l)做softmax的结果这一步在BP算法中不需要特殊处理。  \n\n1.2. Message Passing\nIn the dense CRF formulation of [27], message passing is implemented by applying M Gaussian filters on Q values. Gaussian filter coefficients are derived based on image features such as the pixel locations and RGB values, which reflect how strongly a pixel is related to other pixels. Since the CRF is potentially fully connected, each filter’s receptive field spans the whole image, making it infeasible to use a brute-force implementation of the filters. Fortunately, several approximation techniques exist to make computation of high dimensional Gaussian filtering significantly faster. Following[27], we use the permutohedral lattice implementation [1], which can compute the filter response in O(N) time, where N is the number of pixels of the image [1].\n\n[success] 前向传播过程：方法：applying M Gaussian filters on Q values过程：permutohedral lattice implementation复杂度：O(N)  \n\nDuring back-propagation, error derivatives w.r.t. the filter inputs are calculated by sending the error derivatives w.r.t. the filter outputs through the same M Gaussian filters in reverse direction. In terms of permutohedral lattice operations, this can be accomplished by only reversing the order of the separable filters in the blur stage, while building the permutohedral lattice, splatting, and slicing in the same way as in the forward pass. Therefore, back-propagation through this filtering stage can also be performed in O(N) time. Following [27], we use two Gaussian kernels, a spatial kernel and a bilateral kernel. In this work, for simplicity, we keep the bandwidth values of the filters fixed.\n\n[success] 反向传播过程：方法：sending the error derivatives in reverse direction过程：reversing the order of the separable filters in the blur stage复杂度：O(N)  \n\n1.3. Weighting Filter Outputs\nThe next step of the mean-field iteration is taking a weighted sum of the M filter outputs from the previous step, for each class label l. When each class label is considered individually, this can be viewed as usual convolution with a 1 × 1 filter with M input channels, and one output channel.   \n\n[success] 这一步可以看作是M输入1输出的1x1的卷积层  \n\nSince both inputs and the outputs to this step are known during back-propagation, the error derivative w.r.t. the filter weights can be computed, making it possible to automatically learn the filter weights (relative contributions from each Gaussian filter output from the previous stage). Error derivative w.r.t. the inputs can also be computed in the usual manner to pass the error derivatives down to the previous stage.   \n\n[success]filter weights的计算方法：automatically learn the filter weightsError derivative的计算方法：in the usual manner  \n\nTo obtain a higher number of tunable parameters, in contrast to [27], we use independent kernel weights for each class label. The intuition is that the relative importance of the spatial kernel vs the bilateral kernel depends on the visual class. For example, bilateral kernels may have on the one hand a high importance in bicycle detection, because similarity of colours is determinant; on the other hand they may have low importance for TV detection, given that whatever is inside the TV screen may have different colours.\n\n[warning] 上面这一段没看懂  \n\n1.4. Compatibility Transform\nIn the compatibility transform step, outputs from the previous step (denoted by Qˇ\\check QQˇ​ in Algorithm 1) are shared between the labels to a varied extent, depending on the compatibility between these labels.   \n\n[warning] [?] 这一句没看懂  \n\nCompatibility between the two labels l and l ' is parameterized by the label compatibility function µ(l,l ' ). The Potts model, given by μ(l,l′)=[l≠l′]\\mu(l,l')=[l\\neq l']μ(l,l′)=[l≠l′], where [.] is the Iverson bracket, assigns a fixed penalty if different labels are assigned to pixels with similar properties. A limitation of this model is that it assigns the same penalty for all different pairs of labels. Intuitively, better results can be obtained by taking the compatibility between different label pairs into account and penalizing the assignments accordingly. For example, assigning labels “person” and “bicycle” to nearby pixels should have a lesser penalty than assigning “sky” and “bicycle”. Therefore, learning the function µ from data is preferred to fixing it in advance with Potts model. We also relax our compatibility transform model by assuming μ(l,l′)≠μ(l′,l)\\mu(l,l') \\neq \\mu(l' ,l)μ(l,l′)≠μ(l′,l) in general.\nCompatibility transform step can be viewed as another convolution layer where the spatial receptive field of the filter is 1 × 1, and the number of input and output channels are both L. Learning the weights of this filter is equivalent to learning the label compatibility function µ. Transferring\nerror differentials from the output of this step to the input can be done since this step is a usual convolution operation.  \n\n[success] 这一步可以看作是L输入L输出1 × 1的卷积层，前向和后面传播都不需要特殊处理  \n\n1.5. Adding Unary Potentials\nIn this step, the output from the compatibility transform stage is subtracted element-wise from the unary inputs U. While no parameters are involved in this step, transferring error differentials can be done trivially by copying the differentials at the output of this step to both inputs with the\nappropriate sign.  \n\n[success] 这一层没有要计算的参数，直接使用上一层的偏导  \n\n1.6. Normalization\nFinally, the normalization step of the iteration can be considered as another softmax operation with no parameters. Differentials at the output of this step can be passed on to the input using the softmax operation’s backward pass.\n\n[success] 这一层是softmax，也没有要计算的参数，直接使用上一层的偏导  \n\n"}}}
